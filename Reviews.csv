0,5,"Absolutely love my Dyson UP16!Absolutely love my Dyson UP16! Purchased 2 years ago and only recently had trouble with it. A hole in a hose at the base of the unit and loss of suction. I called the Dyson helpline (conveniently listed on the machine! so I didn't need to google the number). The helpdesk lady was super helpful, took my details and booked the unit in to be serviced. The ladies at the service centre in Coopers Plains QLD were so friendly and made the whole experience easy and effortless. My Dyson was fixed under warranty and ready to be picked up 3 days later (they even offered to post it back at no cost!!). It now operates like a brand new machine again! Soo impressed with their service!!!"
1,5,"Great upright vacuum if you get it at the right priceI said I would never buy a Dyson Vac due to the price point always been too much for what they are. It's not like I don't mind spending the money for a good vacuum and I have spent close to a grand in the past on a high end wet and dry set up but it's just the Dyson product is highly overpriced IMO. But when I got the chance to buy a new light ball for only $360 I jumped and I am so far really happy with how it performs.
My old 15yo upright still works ok but hard to get bags for it now and the Dyson sure does find the dirt and cat hair it could never get up. The brush agitation is a high point for the dyson set up and it really performs well. Turning off the brush and then using it on hard floor surfaces is also great as I don't have to use the barrel vac anymore.

Canister is a bit on the small side but ok for what it is. Filters are easy to get too and clean as well.

The build quality leaves a bit to be desired with a bit too much flex in the handle and also when you pick it up to move it to another room the way the handle comes together means it will pull apart due to not having any firm way to lock down the handle parts so you need to watch that bit.

I feel the unit is far to plastic in its build quality in a negative way over other vacuums that feel far more solid and built to last a long time where with the dyson i think it will not get close to the other vacuums I have for service life.

Still hope I am wrong and will update my review if anything breaks on it.

The ball is a gimmick though and it is no better than other set ups. When you get used to how it moves it can be handy in certain tight corners but the way the handle flexes and the force needed at times to get the ball to go where you want it too means overall it's neither here or there."
2,5,"Do bother! Buy this one!(Title in reference to my last vacuum cleaner review)
This Dyson has excellent suction and comes with some pretty nifty tools, including a 2-in-1 crevice tool/brush attachment, mattress tool and dusting tool.
Honestly, it just does what you want it to, where and when you want it to!
The only disadvantage it has; and others have mentioned this, is that it does feel a little less solid compared to earlier Dyson uprights."
3,5,"Wonderful!This is a dream vacuum cleaner....light, easy to manoeuvre, and enough accessories to make cleaning an enjoyable task. Tried it in the shop and compared to my Miele it is so light!
Couldn’t believe how much fluff it picked up on my ‘so called clean carpets’"
4,5,"Good VacReplaced Hoover vacumn cleaner with dyson light ball upright had a similar one before,so far good bought as a result of a lot of resarch and reviews does leave some tracks in high weave carpet but otherwise good picks up pet hair lead is a bit tedious."
5,5,"Great Suction Easy to assembleI recently purchased an upright Dyson Light ball
Multi surface vacuum. I’ve had the barrel dyson in the past but thought the upright would be better hand height. The suction is amazing and the multi floor head works very well. It is a little heavy to push, so this may be a little negative vs the barrel option.
Overall I’m satisfied with this product."
6,5,"Dyson V15s - A Good VacThis is my fifth Dyson stick vacuum and with each model they improve. I didnt purchase this for the Submarine fitting, being more focussed on improved battery and performance. I have a house with three cats and a dog so pet hair is a problem, the floor is vinyl tiles, I found the green laser a god send in locating fur and other dust particles, the suction is very good and forward and back is adequate to pick up all particles. The unit came with an upright stand, it is a bit flimsy and I would have preferred the wall mount charging dock. The battery life is an improvement on my V10, I dont have any carpet so I cant comment on carpet performance.
I viewed a number of Youtube videos on the submarine attachment, this is not a wet and dry vacuum, there is no suction via the submarine attachment, it collect any particles and water in the submarine attachement, frankly I was suprised at some of the Youtube videos comparing the unit to wet and dry vacs, sucking up plates of spilt porridge, mounds of dirt and bowls of corn flakes, this attachment is simply for cleaning smooth floors, the wet roller runs over the floor and dirty water is squeezed into the waste collection, it cleaned adequately and the amount of effort and results was similar to my steam mop and left the same amount of water on the floor, filling and cleaning the submarine head is fiddly."
7,5,"Good Vacuum but Wet roller does not remove stain!Since I’m on a review spree, I thought I give my opinion on the new Dyson v15 detect submarine. I bought this when it came out last year and paid $1,549. The vacuum is very good, sucks up all the dust particles and dog fur very well which I love, however the wet roller does not remove stains or anything. It just glides on the floor and makes it wet pretty much. It’s also hard to get the water out of the fluffy mop and takes awhile for it to dry."
8,5,Great vacuum cleanerI've never really been a fan of dyson until now. The v15 detect vacuum with the submarine head is great. I can vacuum the whole house and then change the head over and mop the floors on 1 charge. This vacuum is great on pet hair too. I have carpet and vinyl floors
9,5,"Best investment ever!!!I’ve had v15 submarine for over a month and I have to say its the best investment I’ve ever made!!
I upgraded from the Dyson ball that I previously had and what a huge difference it’s been! I have two small kids so the house gets dirty fairly quickly. I use the vacuum daily. The battery time is perfect for my house (4 bedroom house with carpeting upstairs and hard floors downstairs). I can get the whole house done in one charge.
A bit about the vacuum: It come with various attachments. My favourite is the fluffy optic cleaner head!!!! It cleans hard floors with a green light that detects all the tiny particles that are invisible to the naked eye. Again wow. Love this tool!
There’s the Motorbar cleaner head for carpets. Compared to my previous Dyson, it is pulling so much dust from the carpets that I’m shocked. I’ve noticed my dust allergies improve since I bought this vacuum. Plus if I’m in a hurry I can quickly use it on hard floors as well.
Then there’s the Submarine head! I initially tossed with the idea of getting the v15 absolute detect instead of the v15 absolute detect submarine (which is the v15 plus the submarine head) but I ended up buying the submarine because it was on sale at the time. Compared to my previous Eufy wet n dry vac, again the cleaning is so good! While i have to vacuum first and then use the submarine head, I definitely prefer it this way because the cleaning is miles better! There are never any streaks left behind (hard floors or tiles) and and if find that I’ve gone over an area more than once and it’s wet, I simply roll the vacuum over it without turning it on and it dries up right away. Plus the clean up of the vacuum afterwards is a breeze. Just put the roller under running water and that’s it! It also comes with a drip tray, which is where I leave the submarine head once I’m done using it.
The vacuum comes with several other smaller tools. There’s the hair screw tool which I’ve regularly been using on my fabric and velvet sofas. It works amazingly! There’s also a combination tool which is great for the car. And the built in crevice tool to get in small narrrow places. I love that Dyson have it built into the main vacuum stick so you don’t have go looking for it when you need it. Simply take off the main stick and use it quickly.
Finally the floor dock. Love this feature because all the tools can stored on it while the vacuum charges and I won’t be misplacing any of them.
In terms on clean up the vacuum, besides the fluffy, everything can be opened up and washed easily.
The only negative: My hand does get tired from having to hold the power button while vacuuming. I wish Dyson had put a power button on the display screen instead. That said, I’ve done some research and there are several cheap options to buy a trigger lock so I don’t have to keep the button pressed down while vacuuming. Il be ordering one soon.
All in all, an amazing product that I would highly recommend!"
10,5,"It’s almost perfect!This is our 4th Dyson and the best so far
Waste bin size is great
Can vacuum a 390sqm home easily on one charge
Easy to assemble and use
Floor washing is brilliant - ensure the roller is wet before you start though.
Loses points as the crevice tool is stored in the neck of the vacuum reducing the size of waste traveling good up the tube. Had one blockage already.
Overall a great stick vacuum and would recommend"
11,5,Large bin and powerfulThis extra outsize Dyson will clean any large home without emptying the bin. It has 3 power suction settings with the medium setting giving about 45 minutes vacuuming time and the extra powerful Boost setting about 10 minutes. It comes with loads of accessories for every possible need. Once finished simply hang back in its wall charging bracket to recharge battery in quick time. 
12,5,"Too Much Fun(For those wondering like I was, the Absolute Extra package is the Outsize gold edition + stand.)
Purchased this on the advice of another Border Collie owner. I was struggling with the amount of hair I had to vacuum up each week (was using an older ball/barrel type). I was dubious because:
1. Dyson are expensive, and
2. Everyone says cordless stick vacs can't keep up

This one can. It absolutely can. The cannister size is a must for long-haired dog owners, as is the fur/hair attachment. It's also a stupid amount of fun to use. On ECO I get 45 minutes of vacuuming time. On Auto, I get 20-25 (mixed carpet/tile floors). On Boost I get 15 (I find 10 minutes every few days more than sufficient though, so I've never come close to running the battery down). It's a little heavier than its smaller counterpart (no surprises there), but you get used to it after a day or so. Also, having the stand is a nice addition.

My only gripe (and the reason for the 4/5 stars) is Dyson's approach to pricing. I ordered the vacuum a week before it went on sale on their website, $250 cheaper than if I'd waited seven days. Dyson refused to match, saying it's not policy. Okay, understandable, but still annoyed. Not annoyed enough to leave anything less than four stars though, because this vacuum really is amazing."
13,5,"Love it, powerful, great for large homes with petsJust purchased the Dyson Outsize Absolute Extra and have been using it for a week. We have a large house with over 280 square meters of living space with tiles and carpets. On first pass it filled the entire bin as per attached pic. I am very impressed with what it sucked out of the carpets as I was using a Meile corded vacuum (designed specifically for pets) and the new Dyson cordless picked up more debris from the carpets then a corded vacuum. As such, this is the first cordless vacuum that I would state as having the power of a corded vacuum. It also transitions seamlessly from hard floor to carpets. And more impressive is the anti tangle feature as I have 2 daughters with very long hair plus a dog and the hair did not wrap around the motor-bar roller which was a pet hate with the old Dyson v6 that has since died. Only drawback is that is that the unit is a little bulky and my wrist got a little tied after cleaning the entire house. And I'm still waiting for the extension hose which I'll use to clean the car. I bought the Dyson Outsize Absolute Extra recently for only $1250 with stand and the extension hose. I was also considering the v15 at $1499 but with the discount it was great value for money plus the Outsize is fantastic for large homes with pets. Battery life is excellent as I still had 50% remaining after vacuuming 280 square meters. And its very easy to maintain as you can remove the motor-bar roller in seconds as well as the main barrel from the main unit."
14,5,"Dyson Outsize - takes the chore out of vacumming!We purchased this vacuum for our timber laminate flooring. We liked the oversized head which covered the floor area in a quicker time. Along with the super strong suction and oversized catch bin it made the choice easy. We're definitely thrilled with the purchase and the whole house is done very quickly AND thoroughly!! It draws up the finest dirt particles and pet hair disappears in an instant!! Whilst it's a tad on the heavy side, that's to be expected with an oversize head & bin."
15,5,"Convenient, good suction but terrible batteryI really loved this vacuum. It is very convenient and easy to use. I used it for quick cleaning on coaches and inside my car. The battery did not last though. I bought a replacement battery, it only lasted a month.
Pros
- very handy
- convenient
- perfect quick and light vacuuming
- easy to clean and empty

Cons
- you have to keep holding the power button to operate
- battery did not last long"
16,5,"Perfect for a quick clean upI've owned mine for over 2 years and absolutely love it. On advice from my mum, I hardly ever use the max setting as this seems to affect the battery performance over time. It works perfectly fine on the normal setting and is very handy for a quick clean up around the house (tiles and carpet flooring). A single charge lasts for about 20 minutes of use and it charges fairly quickly."
17,5,High quality as expectedI live in a small studio apartment in the city. V7 trigger is small enough but packed a lot of power and can pick the small dust particles. I have tiles in the kitchen otherwise carpet so the v7 really helps a lot to get rid of the dust. It has 2 settings: high and max suction The only thing could be improved is that max suction will last for over a little 5 minutes otherwise whole charge will last me many days of using it. It does not have a fast charge. You may also need an extension hose accessory which you need to buy a separately so you can vacuum cuum those crevices and tight spaces.
18,5,Good suctionIt has a good suction and it is easy to clean. Easy to through the rubbish and dust in the compartment. Overall I like it very much but the charge doesn’t last long. I use it with high power and last only 6minutes. But it’s good enough for me.
19,5,"Your carpet isn't clean until you use this DysonWe thought the old Hoover wasn't cleaning properly, it had good suction but seemed to leave a lot of fur and stuff behind. Bought this Dyson and never thought we had so much hair, fluff and dirt still in the carpet. We have a large rug and it looks like new now, could not be happier with this vacuum, especially when compared to those expensive stick vacs."
20,5,"This is a life changing cleaning machine!I've had this for a week now - when it first arrived I used my old vac first, so I could see what else came out of the carpets, and it was a LOT. I have 2 dogs - one with long black fur and one with short black and white fur - and it is everywhere. The Dyson didn't skip a beat - it just sucked it all up, along with my hair and everything else - and it's so easy to empty. I had read reviews that it's heavy - well, it's not (I'm used to carrying 25kg bags of chook food, so this is less than half that). It's easy to carry up the stairs, I love the fact that it is an upright, and it stands neatly in a corner, ready to remove fur at a moments notice. My previous vacuum was an expensive Electrolux pet vacuum that just moved the fur around and became clogged. This does what it promises after one or two swipes over any area. And it has pulled embedded dirt from between floorboards and even out of the grout between tiles. I would say that this is the best vacuum I've ever had - and it's especially good at preventing the floating rafts of fur I have become accustomed to floating across the floor since I became a dog person."
21,5,"This is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever!My previous vacuum cleaner of 10 years died, and I decided to replace it with the same brand.
This one is more powerful and easy to maneuver, I love the fact that the head is smaller and fits perfectly in smaller places. The cord is longer which means I can nearly do my whole house in one go! "
22,5,"BrilliantThis machine is worth its weight in gold. Easy to set up and use, it's quiet and cleans the floors beautifully. Bought a second dock from the Dyson website for surprisingly little, so it can do the top floor too, but the whole unit is so light you could easily just pick it up and plug it in on another floor Previously had a Roomba J9+ that I ended up returning and the whole unit was so heavy I couldn't get even lift it myself. This one is far, far superior."
23,5,"Perfect all rounder vacuum for the neat freakA great vacuum with the added convenience of a larger bin . The laser technology on the Motörhead is absolutely amazing ! I vacuumed with our old vac and then tried the gen5 outsize with the laser head and you wouldn’t believe how much dust our old vacuum left behind! The laser shows up the dirty floors and it’s easy to see after going over the floor with this product how effective it is at removing dust, dirt and even works superbly to remove all traces of pet hair. Works great on hard or soft floors, just attach the soft head for hard floors that are prone to scratches and your set. Comes with lots of handy little attachments for various uses. Very impressed with this machine and will continue using at home and also for our cleaning business."
24,5,"Surprisingly goodI have had this vacuum for a couple of months. It is used exclusively on hard floors (tiles), so I can't really comment how it would go on carpet.
I am quite happy with it's performance. It has an ""Auto"" setting for the suction level which provides for a reasonable run time and is effective for cleaning my floors.

On ""Turbo"" the suction is surprisingly strong for a stick vacuum, although on this setting run time is pretty short - perhaps 5 or 6 minutes only.

The machine is pretty quiet, it's fairly easy to use and seems well constructed.

On the minus side the vacuum (and it's wall mounted dock) are a bit bulky, and the dock is slightly awkward to position the vacuum on.

I took one star off for the fact that the self cleaning brush roll function really doesn't work. You still need to manually remove the brush roll and pull / cut away any tangled hair. At least the brush roll is easy to remove, with no tools needed (although the metal retaining spring that sits over it is hard to open and even harder to snap closed).

Overall I am quite happy with this vacuum - particularly at the price paid of $284.

Recommended."
25,5,"Can't live without my robotMy robot cleans every day and it's amazing how much she picks up when you think your place is clean. I have hard floors and a few mats, a couple of small steps and she manages incredibly well. Custom service is spot on."
26,5,"Love the Electrolux UltimateHome 700 vacuum cleanerI want to buy a cheap vaccum cleaner to support my Dyson stick vacuum as it only lasts about 20 minutes and to get into difficult spots that the Dyson can’t. I did not want to spend more than $300.
I saw the UltimateHome 700 at the Good Guys. The vaccum looks cheap and nasty but don’t let that fools you.

Instead of using my Dyson, I made the decision to try out the new vaccum cleaner and I was surprise and shock how much dirt was in the dust bin.

Best investment I ever made."
27,5,"Excellent robot vacuumHave had this i9.2 (Animal edition) running for a few weeks now, and it does an amazing job on our all lino floored living area.
Once it has 'learned' the floor mapping, it is super easy to break the map up into zones, and size them to be done in a single battery charge. Best life from battery so far is around 45 minutes, and it cleans around 45sq meters of hard floor.

The 0.7 litre bin is plenty for our usage, and is very easy to clean. The dust filter is protected by a mesh screen inside the bin as well, and animal hair is easily removed.

The app (Electrolux 'Wellbeing') is excellent, and very easy to use on iOS.

Pro's - Small and triangle means it gets into corners and around office chairs well.
- excellent cleaning on hard floors.
- good bin size, and easy to clean.
- battery life is fine, recharges quickly.
- excellent at navigating, very gentle.

Con - is very sensitive to height, and wont go under the couch despite having plenty of clearance. I cant find a setting to change that. Would have been 5 star review otherwise.

Purchased from HN - $650 or so - the Animal version is a bit more than the version listed at top of page.

Very impressed, highly recommended."
28,5,"It Does What Its Supposed ToWe replaced the equivalent Bosch rechargeable with this. Much better! LED is very handy for showing up dirt, the service duration is good after a full charge, and its easy to empty and clean. Useful as a hand-held too."
29,5,"Effective cleaning and amazing battery lifeWe got this vacuum as a replacement under a warranty claim from Electrolux (who were great to deal with). The old version which died was a well loved machine in our house and this newer model does not disappoint.
The battery lasts long enough to vacuum our largeish two storey house including carpet, tiles and hardwood floors.
The machine is very maneuverable and the LED lights on the head help to track down otherwise invisible dust in low light.
The canister is easy to empty and always contains a pleasing yet slightly disturbing amount of dust, hair and grime.
The detachable hand unit is great for cleaning the inside of the car and probably does 80% as good a job as our much larger plug in Electrolux ultra silencer vacuum.
The vacuum comes with a lot of attachments we haven't used yet, but we are looking forward to deploying it to get rid of dust on our wooden Venetian blinds.
Highly recommended unit and amazing value for the usual purchase price."
30,5,"Excellent choiceI have a Hoover Vortex Pro that is awful. So, buying a stick vacuum for my daughter I did a lot of research before buying and am very happy with my choice. It is light and easy to use. The hand held unit clips in and out smoothly. Cleans effectively, quiet, the swivel head is really good, light is handy and the battery lasts well. It is easy to empty the dirt chamber (Hoover is impossible) and clean the filter, and we are amazed how much dirt it picks up, and we are clean people! Definitely recommend to buy this one."
31,5,"Finally a stick vacuum with a useful crevice tool! 5 STARS!Our 5 year old cordless stick vacuum battery died. As we were so happy with the model and after a lot a research on other brands, we decided to stay with the same model mainly for the swivel head. I waited patiently for the unit to come on sale, so we saved almost $100.
We were pleasantly surprised with all the new tools that came with this
Ergorapido 18V cordless vacuum. The old one had only the mini useless crevice tool.

The new long crevice tool actually does fit in the window tracks. Hallelujah finally one that fits!

I have taken a photo to compare to the Dyson v11 crevice tool which is too wide to fit into window tracks.

Instructions are more Ikea like, in other words, no words! No online manual either.

Without instructions, with the old unit we did not realise for 2 years that the crevice tool was stored in the charging unit. Same for the new model. See photo.

DO NOT be persuaded to buy the 14v model to save money. You need the extra sucking power of the 18v model which is the one I am reviewing.

This improved model has a larger window to see if the barrel needs to be emptied. I like that.

Love the charging stand. Another reason for buying this brand."
32,5,"Great machine!Excellent for quick vacuums and more! Just become familiar with cleaning the filters. ( have a spare or 3!). And beware of hair in the head. Remove it and cut any hair off. I own two of them.
Garry."
33,5,"Great Second VacThis a great second vacuum for everyday use. We get the main cleaner out periodically for a deeper clean though this is less often now. If the speed with which the canister fills is anything to go by it does a good job on both hard floors and carpets. It's size and manoeuvrability makes it great for tight and low clearance and stairs. It has plenty of charge for the way we use it. Emptying the canister is easy. It is well-built and doesn't take up much space when not it use. Better than I expected, this is a perfect ""between deep clean"" vacuum."
34,5,"Excellent suction but the cord does not retract!!Fantastic suction I use it on carpet and tiles, it literally lifts the carpet up it is that good! It has lifted out a lot of dirt and dust even after I used my Dyson! It's very light and easy to move around. The only issue is that my cord will not retract!! Very annoying."
35,5,"Best vacuum cleaner everI tested this in the store and couldn't believe the suction compared to other vacuums. It is really light to manoeuvre, with a very long cord, which is very useful and removing the dust drawer is super easer. It's a great design, very quiet and very straight forward to use and most importantly has the best suction of any vacuum I've ever used. Fantastic price too for such an amazing product. Highly recommend."
36,5,So powerfulI replaced my Dyson for this vac I should have done so a couple of years ago. It is so powerful super long cord no need for an extension lead. I will never go back to Dyson now I have this. One down side the plastic doesn’t seem as strong as the Dyson. So will see how long it lasts but performance wise 10/10
37,5,"An exceptional vacuum for the priceI've had this vac since May 2020. The cord is awesome. It is so long, that I can do the whole house without changing power points. The suction is incredible, unless you have very low pile carpet, you won't be able to use full power as the suction is very strong. Beats the previous Dyson ball vac hands down. Whilst it isn't silent, it is still very quiet. Being bagless, it is a breeze to empty and no worries about buying bags."
38,5,"Perfect vacuum, except cord is not rolled backWe had the vacuum for almost a year, it's great vacuum for it's price and performance, however almost since we bought it the cord stopped rolling back. So we have always about half a metre out of it. "
39,5,"Best vacuum cleanerThis vacuum cleaner was an ""emergency"" click and collect purchase after my previous one (Vax animal) broke down during lockdown after just 7months of use. I am super delighted with this Electrolux vacuum cleaner. It is used on carpet (carpet everywhere!) and whilst it is not a lightweight performer it is doing an amazing job in getting lots of dirt, dust out of the carpet. I love how quiet it is (after the VAX)and its long cable is amazing. It is so powerful that if I change the setting to the max I cannot even lift it up from the carpet - it gives you a workout- and yet it is quiet. One thing I would change: put the green, yellow and red tapes on the cord so that one knows how much more to the end of it - especially when it is this long. Overall, I am super impressed in this vacuum cleaner, excellent value, hopefully lasts 5years :)"
40,5,Best Vacuum Ever!I highly recommend this vacuum very light easy to manoeuvre also very powerful! Works great on tiles and carpet! I can’t believe all the things it picks up and despite it’s not the silent performer one it’s relatively quiet. Overall I’m very happy with my purchase.
41,5,"Excellent MachineElectrolux really does its best with what they have been doing forever, make great vacuums. I mostly have hard surfaces in my house and few rugs, it's great on both. It's easy to empty and you can easily see how much dust is in the clear dust case. I have some allergies and I don't get any sniffles either when using this vacuum or afterward. If you want an awesome bagless vac, then this is it."
42,5,"Best VacuumWe have a multi cat household. We have carpet in the bedrooms and tiles and rugs elsewhere. This vacuum cleaner is, without a doubt, one of the best I've owned. I have to vacuum each day and it breezes through the house beautifully. Excellent value."
43,5,"Excellent performance, great priceExcellent suction. I have 3 dogs and it picked up all their fur from the carpet. The cyclonic/filter set up performs strongly, captures all the fine dust. Runs reasonably quietly, long cord, good accessories. Would recommend it over other name brands."
44,5,Excellent Vacuum cleanerFor the price this is a very well performing vacuum. It is extra quiet and lifts dirt very well. We have used ours now for about 15 months and never had any issues with it. Very good all round vacuum.
45,5,"Impressive!Bought this vacuum today and OMG! I had the house cleaned last week but still managed to get 3 bags full of pet hair off the carpeted area in the living room. Great suction even at minimum and needs no effort to push around. Other reviews have mentioned short cord, didnt find that an issue. Happy with it, lets hope it continues to please."
46,5,"So impressed with my vacuum!I bought this as it was an affordable vacuum. I wasn't expecting it to be great, however the power in this vacuum has me so impressed. It's quiet enough that I can vacuum when the baby is asleep which is perfect. Filter is easy to clean, and it packs away well for storage."
47,5,"Awesome ProductWe bought Electrolux Silent Performer Green Barrel Vacuum and we really like it. It does an amazing job because when we just moved in, after 2 days we used the vacuum to clean the place and we got a lot of dirt, which we thought we shouldn't have since we just moved in and for sure the place was cleaned properly."
48,5,"Very quietOn hard floors works well. On carpets it’s good enough for what you need. Would possibly help having a motorised brush head. Have to turn the power to minimum for doing rugs. So quiet compared to others, you can even have a conversation whilst using."
49,5,"Love it it's awesomeThis is the most powerful vacuum I've ever had, and am completely happy with it. Could not believe what it picked up. Easy to empty, easy to use, long cord etc. At such a reasonable price you can't go wrong."
50,5,"Cleans WellThis vacuum cleaner is very easy to use, durable and really does the job. It is very powerful, so if you've got so much dust at home and you really need to clean every day, this one's for you. However, it is quite noisy, bulky and heavy, so it is not really advisable for those who have two-floor houses. But overall, it does perform well and it's very easy to maintain."
51,5,ImpressedI purchased this vacuum from The Good Guys and they were flexible on price and the sales person was across the aspects of the model. I have been impressed with its performance. I have only previously owned Dyson's and this vacuum is out performing the Dyson for suction and cleaning for the price. Highly recommend
52,5,"Great vacuum minor issuesOwned for 10 months now. This vacuum is probably the best vacuum I have ever used or had. It has extreme carpet lifting suction. Only two gripes. The lead is short, you have to move room to room. If only it was even just one metre longer. The other issue is the rear(final filter), it is washable but the two layers of filter come apart after first wash so will need to replace after maybe 6 months if you have messy kids and animals with finer dust. It does benefit from a good wipe out and all filter wash after maybe every third fill especially if a lot of finer dust in the place. Overall great vacuum though."
53,5,"Huge suckage! Not so huge silence!I bought this vacuum to replace a Dyson and a Vax, both bagless and both absolute wastes of money. We have a hairy household; 3 humans with hair and 3 cats who seem to shed more hair than they own. This vacuum sucks so hard it lifts my carpet up. I've had to dial it down to prevent it from removing my carpet all together. It doesn't come with a powered head so it does require significant strength to push it across the carpet, but I bought a cheap $36 head from ebay that fits all and it does the job perfectly, though the amount of suction still means I get a good workout. Combined with the amount of heat this sucker pumps out you'll sweat and feel like you've done a good cardio session after vaccing. I'm not sure if this is a pro or con, but considering I vacuumed the house with way less swearing than I usually do with the bagless varieties, even taking into account the sweat, I'm calling it a win.
One thing though; whatever marketing genius came up with this name must be residing on an alternate universe. Or lives in space where there's no sound. This machine howls. And screams. And is quite honestly deafening. While I didn't mind the sweat, it took longer for me to regain my hearing. My kids found it hilarious to yell at me about how loud the silence was while I was unable to her anything apart from the sonic boom of this thing. So don't expect silence, or even relative quiet. This machine is LOUD! But it sucks really well. And you get a free workout. All up I'm strangely happy and would recommend.

Edit:
A year later and I absolutely love this vaccuum! It does the job so well. Still not silent, and the cats flee as soon as I touch it, but it's great! If it dies I'd buy another in a heartbeat (here's hoping it keeps on keeping on though)."
54,5,"After much research and value for money considerations we bought an Electrolux Stick VacuumThe Dyson was our first choice based on neighbors experience and reviews posted on line from various sources. The cost of same was ridiculous by comparison with other similar units.
We bought an Electrolux WellQ7 model mainly to be used on hard floors with some carpet and rug applications. The warranty submission was easy on line and the charging system is simple and easy to use.
The unit charges quickly, the light on the front that we thought may be a gimmick is actually very helpful and we find the cleaner is easy to use with a simple on off switch that you do not have to hold like a trigger switch. It came with two heads and although early days we are happy with the suction and brush arrangement and can get the unit under most beds and furniture.
The unit cost $435 from Betta Electrical and the advice and purchase from the vendor was helpful."
55,5,Very pretty but frustrating to upkeepIt often turns off when fully charged. It does not seem very powerful. A somewhat frustrating device with a cute light and nice design.
56,5,In constant use!I did a lot of research on this site before purchasing this vac. I already have the Hoover Cat & Dog but hauling it around daily during the Feb/March shedding months has been a chore. The Q7 is light and easy on the back and perfect for zipping around at any time. The car is much cleaner as well! The headlight and swivell head are both fantastic! I ordered online at Godfrey's and received the vac within 48hrs.
57,5,"Big Improvement over the old ErgorapidoGot this to replace an old Ergorapido Lithium.
Works very well, battery sufficient to do all carpets and hard floors in the house.
Small power head attachment is great for the car and small jobs.
Only issue is the charging station is a bit flimsy compared to the Ergorapido"
58,5,"Great Vacuum CleanerWe have a short haired dog and regularly vacuum the place. Purchased this as a small second vacuum to have around for quick jobs. After seeing how much stuff this picked up from our, what we already thought was clean, carpet, we now use it more than the corded vacuum we have. Love it.
Battery life is around 25-30min, which I find pretty good."
59,5,"Very Handy, love itHad one of these electrolux years ago swore I would never buy another as after a while they just keep switching off by them selves. Here I am with a new one love it, but the first one I bought 4 weeks ago started switching off after 30 seconds turn back on and it switches off again so I took it back and they have replaced it with another one the same, and I am very happy with it, just hope it lasts."
60,5,"Great VacuumI use this vacuum on both my carpet and tiles floors. Great, handy machine and love the fact that it has a light so you can see spots that you may have missed.
I feel this works better on the tiles than carpet, but overall I am happy with the battery life and weight. Quick and easy to clean as well!"
61,5,"Great timesaverThis is a great rechargeable vacuum cleaner. I love that I can press the button and vacuum stays on, no more holding down the button to keep appliance working. It has great suction and long battery life, highly recommended, not as expensive as some of the other brands on the market."
62,5,"pets and people this is the best value upright vacuum cleanerno matter how many times you you vacuum one spot that pet hair won't be picked up to your satisfaction... unless you buy the electrolux upright vacuum cleaner Well Q7. If you pay under $300 , you are wasting your money . Great for the elderly, great for domestic cleaning businesses, this grab and go has the power it takes to clean up your beloved pet's hairs or a quick ""do over"" at home. The fact the hand held is at the base, not the top, gives great balance and no strain on the wrists. commercial domestic cleaners will love it for it's ease of use , one fully charged will get your job done with ease. Highly recommended after wasting money on the imitations. nearly two years on this vacuum works as well as the day we started it's heavy duty usage. Very happy with this product."
63,5,"A great vacuum and so pretty!I was looking for a new stick vacuum that also doubled as a handheld dust buster with a skinny head (to get down the sides of car seats etc) and this one was just perfect. Not only is it super pretty (red is my colour scheme, so I was stoked!), it has fantastic suction and picks up things in corners and along walls without having to face the head into the wall, you just run along side. It is lightweight, has a very handy light on the front and is easy to clean and empty. Picks up dog hair, dirt and other small debris without having to run over the carpet 5 times. Short battery life so you couldn't do the whole house in one sweep, but it charges pretty quickly and is great for spot cleans. So happy with this purchase!"
64,5,"Pretty good for the price pointFirst of all I’d like to get out of the way what the Electrolux Well Q7 vacuum cleaner isn’t so I can review based on what it is :-)
It is not Dyson. Even though it might directly compete with older, cheaper, earlier Dyson models - it is not comparable.
It is not performing as your typical corded vacuum cleaner. While it is good, it in most cases wont replace strengths of vacuuming corded appliances.
It is “not that” expensive
Previously I had a Dyson V8 and V11 (still have V11). Naively I’d like to compare my experience with the Electrolux Well Q7 vacuum to a particular Dyson. I should not. Dyson is designed differently, operates mostly differently and sold at a different price point. However, at the price point it is sold it’s not that bad of a value proposition.
General quality of the appliance is good and it is relatively easy to use. Some things are even designed better than those at Dyson. For example, the docking station. You don’t have to screw the docking station to the wall to mount the vacuum. Big bonus for those of us who rent. Also, the Electrolux Well Q7 vacuum has all its attachments neatly stored within the vacuum cleaner body. That’s awesome. I always struggle to neatly store all the attachments that came with the Dyson. The vacuuming rotating brush also has inbuilt LED light. It is very handy when vacuuming darker places.
The first charge (charge from empty) takes around 4 hours. Not good, not bad, just important to know for those that expect “things in an instant”.
Operation is straightforward and in general the vacuum does a great job for the price point. There is an option to slow down/speed up cleaning brush rotation and sucktion to save power for non-carpet surfaces. While I didn’t time battery usage it is enough to vacuum the average Australian house and there is juice for some more.
The way vacuum is designed is that the “actual vacuum cleaner” can be detached from the main frame and used to vacuum cars, trickier surfaces and not so easy to reach places.
The only thing that I truly dislike is emptying the dust. Not only is the container small, it is also almost impossible to open it up without dust flying around. Not sure if I’m overreacting, but in comparison with Dyson it is not well designed.
Despite all of the above, I consider the Electrolux Well Q7 vacuum to be pretty good especially considering the price point. I would not hesitate to recommend it especially if you can’t afford the latest and greatest Dyson."
65,5,"Not a bad small bagless vacuum cleanerI purchased this bagless electrolux second hand recently and apart from emitting a smell( which is not as bad now) it's pretty good! Im a domestic house cleaner and have used many types of vacuum cleaners. Good points: Easy empty, lightweight and powerful suction, longish wand and easy to pull around...
The Negatives: Apart from a smell from the motor, The cord is way to short and dust get's stuck at the top of the vacuum cannister which entails pulling the barrel apart to get to it.
I do like it better than my small Bosch. To improve it Electrolux please have Better washable fabric filters( like a Dyson) a longer cord and wand and better sealed cannister. Overall it's a handy little vacuum with ample suction. Many people forget to maintain their vacuum cleaners and when they break down, they just blame the brand. Everyone please maintain and look after your vacuum cleaners and they should look after you!"
66,5,"Mostly has been a great vacuumI have had this vacuum for a year, I actually use it at work for office cleaning as I cant carry a back-vac and it has been powerful and reliable as long as i keep the filters clean and empty it regularly. Has been good at home with cat hair. The turbo head however I don't use as it has been ineffective on any surface. It can tip over at times."
67,5,"Versatile, great little vacuum that is good value for moneyOriginally I considered buying a stand-up, rechargeable vacuum such as the Dyson D7 but the reviews were terrible due to the limited life span of the battery and short usage time before the battery runs out.
I therefore opted for the the Electrolux Ease C4 and am very happy with my purchase for the following reasons:
1. It has multiple attachments suitable for my parquet flooring, carpets/rugs and a nifty tool for getting behind sofa cushions and in window stills etc.
2. Compact and fairly lightweight.
3. Unlimited battery life as it plugs into mains
4. Looks good in sexy red :)

I would not hesitate to recommend. Great product for the low price."
68,5,"Simple to use. Easy to cleanFast to use. Cleans well. Not too noisy. Easy to empty and to clean.
The different heads you receive, make cleaning any surface a breeze. Also cleans the car without any issues."
69,5,"Powerful and relatively silentI was previously using a lowest priced aldi vacuum, so my comparison is with that. I was looking for something which works on both hard (wooden) and carpet floor. My budget was around 250$, this product was on discount on GoodGuys and bought it at 224$ (usually 299$). I got a good product a good price as well. I have used few times now, first and foremost, easy to throw the dust away. I was surprised to see lot of dust collected when I used it first time (coz of previous vacuum). This is quite as well, it makes noise coz of powerful air suction when you take it off the ground, otherwise way lesser noise. I would recommend it to my friends. Real value for money"
70,5,"Perfect vacuum cleanerIt is a powerful vacuum I bought this model last July, it is simple to use not too heavy to carry also it picks the fur, hair and dust very well. I use it to clean different floor tiles and sofa also it easy to clean and maintain as it is a bagless vacuum model."
71,5,"Great vacuum cleaner 4 price. Almost comparable to expensive ones. Only 4 stars cos hose cant be taken apart 2 upclogI""ve watched youtube videos & read how to unclog hose with hooks etc but it certainly would make life a lot easier if it could be separated to clear blockages easier. I love that the filter can be washed & dried & using a small paintbrush easily clears out fine dust accumulated & see through collection bin is helpful also"
72,5,"Lightweight, easy to manoeuvre and good battery lifeI wanted a light weight cordless vacuum that was easy to manoeuvre around and under furniture but would still have decent suction and battery life. I'm very happy so far with the Q9 Animal cordless vacuum that I bought for this purpose. It is very light and easy to move around furniture, fits under my couches and vacuums well on tiles, carpet and rugs with the battery lasting well and the dust container - though small - is very easy to empty. It's so easy to use that I don't hate vacuuming when using it - whereas my Dyson upright corded vacuum has great suction but is much more cumbersome due to its weight and cord and not fitting under couches or around chair legs etc so I dreaded having to vacuum.
Oh and it's much quieter than the Dyson."
73,5,"Incredible suction!I bought it yesterday and gave it a try. Everything is great. It is light weight, easy to clean and pull apart, provided you read the instructions! Having to turn the machine on to remove the cleaning head is certainly unusual. As a handheld, it’s brilliant. I have low pile carpet and rug, lino, and wooden flooring. I am especially pleased that there are no bristles for me to have to remove hair from! The dust collector is very small but because it is so easy to empty it’s not really that much of a problem."
74,5,"Great little vacuumSuper easy to use, sucks amazingly well and easy to empty."
75,5,"Perfect little upright vacuum!I originally bought this vacuum because it was on sale, and now I'm using it on a daily basis on every flooring you can think of. It doesn't skip a beat, the suction is incredible, the amount of dirt and dust this little vacuum removes is amazing. Only down fall is the catchment is tiny so u will have to empty it quite often if your flooring is rather soiled"
76,5,Budget friendly vaccuum!My unit is fully carpeted so I bought this product yesterday and must say that I am highly impressed with it’s functionality for its price. I have used it in my carpeted floor and couch as well. It is light and easy to carry. Only downside is the device is corded which also means you will never be out of battery while using it. Happy with this product for my tiny studio unit.
77,5,"Amazing!!!What a great product. Light weight and very efficient at cleaning. I use it on carpet and vinyl flooring, as well as my couch are car. The amount of dirt if picks up is incredible."
78,5,"Powerful lightweight work horseI bought a Hoover cordless for $600. Waste of money. Lasted two years. I have a 40 year old Miele which is really good but wanted a light weight vac to run around the main living room each day. We have a dark grey plain carpet which shows everything. So I bought the Bissell Featherweight. Wow! what a machine. Great suction. Two of my friends have tried mine and bought one. I went to Betta Electrical. They gave me a great price (because I buy all my electrical goods from them). Yes, you do have to plug it in but that is no hassle for me. It performs just as well on my Karndean Flooring as it does on the carpet. It is not noisy. I have not used it as a dustbuster yet as I have another vac in the garage for the car. I have had it for three months now and find it is easy to empty. I absolutely love this machine and would recommend it to everyone in the market for a lightweight vac."
79,5,"Far superior to any battery powered unit. If you want a small, powerful, portable vaccuum cleaner, check this one outI bought this vaccuum cleaner specifically for use on my boat. Storage space is always an issue, so I was looking for a good battery operated product, but I could not find a battery operated vaccuum cleaner with adequate suction power. Even the astronomically high priced battery powered Dyson machines are not very impressive. While checking out my options at Harvey Norman, I noticed the Bissell Featherweight, mains powered vaccuum which is similar in size to many of the battery powered vaccuums. I was very impressed with the suction which far exceeds any battery powered unit. Since I have a 12Vdc to 240Vac inverter on my boat, I don't actually need a battery operated unit. In fact, having a battery in the vaccuum unit has big disadantages, such as needing to charge the battery, limited operating time and limited battery life. The Bissell Featherweight drawers about 33 Amps from the 12V inverter, which is quite acceptable. I am impressed with the simplicity of the design and ease of cleaning the filter. I mainly use it as a hand held vaccuum without the handle extension due to the varied types of surfaces on a boat. I use the small nozzle for crevices and upholstery and the wider surface cleaning attachment for floor and upholstery also. A third attachment that Bissell has not included is a medium sized brush nozzle, which I would find very useful. At $99, it is excellent value."
80,5,"Light to use but powerful in suctionThis vacuum is extremely easy to use. My kids were sick of dragging the big vacuum out to do their chores so I bought them this to make their life easier (and mine) and because it's so easy you can just whip it out and vacuum around in 15 mins for a quick tidy up. I like the fact that it's a plug in with no time limit on batteries and recharging etc, we just use a long extension cord to cover the whole house and it's easy as. It's more efficient on hard surfaces than carpet, although not too bad on on carpet and rugs depending on the thickness of the pile. The best thing about this is the price. We paid $88.00 on sale at Harvey Norman which is a small price to pay for a great product!!"
81,5,"Great little vacuum!Perfect size for my apartment, works great on floorboards and carpet. Very light, easy to manoeuvre and not too loud. Picks up a lot of dust that I can't even see. Love my little bissell."
82,5,"Very helpful for family basic cleaningI did the review check before purchasing it. Even if the floor already had a professional carpet cleaning before I moved in, still get the dirty water after I used the bissell cleaner. l use it every 3 months to clean the carpet. Easy to use! Totally recommend it."
83,5,"Great investmentI’ve used Vacuum/mop on hard floors mainly and the result is excellent. Will not return to mop and bucket ever again. Used on short rugs and great result as well.
Rug and wooden floor are in a house with 1 x white medium dog and 3 cats. Grey floor is mine and we have two huskies, with crazy shedding abilities."
84,5,"One of the best things I've ever bought!Love this vacuum/mop... did my whole house in 15 minutes and it took 4 minutes to clean after. Im using it multiple times a day as i have young children. Its heavy and sturdy, unlike he 5 Dysons Ive been though. I have very high hopes or tis one.. excellent vacuum, great mop and very easy to clean mats, rugs etc at the same time. Really happy with my purchase! Recommend to anyone!"
85,5,"Vacuum and mop in one - I can't go wrong - can't live withoutI've always hated cleaning my floors but since having the new Crosswave Pet I'm cleaning them several times a day. It is so easy to use and my floors look like new. Carpet, tiles, floorboards, lino I use it on all my household surfaces."
86,5,"Love itThis is the vacuum that we recommend to everyone. Purchased it 5 months ago, works as charm. Mops and cleans tiles, cleans carpets. We could not imagine how much dirt is left on a tiled floor after vacuuming with a ordinary ""dry"" vacuum cleaner. Very easy to use and wash. Love it!"
87,5,"The bestBrought this today, came home and tried it out, love it, vacuumed beautifully, mopped great. A must have for any home. Easy to use on both tiles and rug, would definitely recommend."
88,5,Not Perfect but worth buyingI have been wanting a mop/vacuum for years and finally they exist. I bought mine about 9months ago when my steam mop broke. I also have a dog and kids. It does work. I have a large area of tiles and cleaning them is very time consuming. The crosswave reduces my time of cleaning by HALF! I have tried cleaning the rugs in the bathroom while I was cleaning the rest of the house and it made them dirtier. I would suggest doing any carpet first and even changing the rollers. The floor pet Solution smells great! It is a heavy machine to use and you can't get under furniture as it's quite bulky. The dirty water tank does fill up quickly and I have to empty it out before I have finished because if you don't it makes a loud revving sound. If you go on an angle it will also leave dirty water on the ground which is easily to get rid of by vacuuming it up but a little annoying. The plastic lid that goes on top of the rollers seems a little scary as it only clips with plastic hooks that doesn't seem that strong. In saying that I haven't broken anything yet. It is so easy to clean and you can really see by the tank that it is cleaning your floors as all the dirty water and gunk is in a separate container. It does do a very good job and I am happy I purchased it but there is always room for improvement.
89,5,"Hard to believe how fantastic this model isIve been using a Dyson cordless vacuum which was fine compact etc, however my wife had a voucher and went and used as past payment of the Bissell powerforce helix 2110 plug in cord. I am absolutely gobsamacked at the suction power ! Its incredibly strong I found the carpet suction works even better when set between hard floor & carpet setting !
I actually enjoy using the the machine!
Never seen an effect on dust drawn up !
Cord isn’t an issue as the machine is easy and relatively light to handle & when you see the results you just want to run it again r the hell pf it"
90,5,"AmazingFantastic corded vacuum cleaner perfect for apartments, great for cleaning up after dogs. Good on tile, linoleum, carpet and rugs."
91,5,"I love this vacuum on so many levelsI've had this vacuum a couple of years now and the one before this one was also a Bissell similar to this. I cannot fault it , its easy to empty and comes with spare belts which I have never had to use , absolutely love the turbo brush tool which is great for pet hairs but you don't have to have a pet to appreciate it as its wonderful for doing things like the mattress or couch ..I've been married for 43 years so have used many vacuums but for me now i'm sticking to bissell."
92,5,Fantastic vacuumI have been using a well know expensive brand of vacuum and felt it wasn't going a good enough job. I saw the bissel power force and thought for the price I would try it as I own a bissel hard floor cleaner and carpet cleaner and love the performance. I was absolutely amazed with its suction power I though my carpets were clean as I had only vacuum earlier that day but the amount of dust and sand my other vacuum had failed to g lift up was a little surprising. I vacuum everyday ( I have two messy kids and pets) and everyday I was getting more and more deep ingrained dust and dirt out of my carpets. Finally it's all up and it even smells fresher. I had read reviews that it wasn't so good on hard floors but I have not had this problem and think it performs just as good. I would highly recommend this vacuum to anyone looking on a budget I would have paid 3 times the amount for this vacuum.
93,5,"Excellent all round vacuum for the houseEasy to assemble. Expected it to be way noisier than it is. Have two very well know stick vacuums that are useless on somme carpets and any pet hair.This one cleaned three different pile height rugs of all the pat hai and a lot of ingrained sand and dust. Carpets look so fresh and vibrant after just one vacuum. Also picks everything up off hard floors ie tiles, wood etc. Cord length is good and fine once you get used to having a cord again. Changing pile height is easy and no problem if you get it wrong you will know, excellent suction, all round a great addition to the house cleaning arsenal. It is also goor to vac the furniture, car etc with its additional fittinfs and attachments. Also easy to empty canister and clean pre and pro filters."
94,5,"PhenomenalHave tried a couple of battery models and frankly they don't cut it.
So I read reviews and this seemed very good for the money ($169) ; better than that it is as I said phenomenal.
Salesman warned me not to use the low a setting on carpet; he was spot on, suction so powerful that you could almost scalp your carpet. First used it on new carpet that I had cleaned a few times prior with a battery model. To my amazement it cleaned up half a litre of cut fibres in no time at all.
One reviewer said ""expect it to last less than a year"". Standard warranty is 2 years and I added a further 2 years for only $10.
If burnt rubber smell, do the sensible thing and stop immediately, find what has jammed the mechanism & replace the belt if necessary. Far too difficult for some people, I suppose..."
95,5,"BISSELL is a brand I trustThis Vac is a quality build and of excellent design. I have NO TRUST in the multitude of battery driven junk products. This vac is very efficient, easy to use , has a large canister that is so easy to empty and best of all..... NO BATTERIES.
The retractable cord works and the machine is light, robust and easy to move around.
This is an excellent VALUE FOR MONEY product and I highly recommend this powerful unit over the numerous ridiculously priced vacs ( Cost more than a big fridge) that I considered before my purchase at $199.00"
96,5,"Brilliant for large areas of carpet and tileBought a couple of months ago from Harvey Norman after reading these reviews. Vacuum cleaner is easy to assemble and use and versatile on different surfaces. It’s also most satisfying and slightly alarming to see the amount of dust, sand and hair that builds up in the barrel from a clean appearing floor! My back and floors are very happy with the results and I am considering buying another one to keep in case they go out of production. Highly recommended.
Feb/2024 and still going strong!! Great vacuum cleaner."
97,5,"Very HappyI have had so many vacuums that have been unsatisfactory including expensive Dysons, that I was hesitant to buy yet another one. When I saw this Bissell for $199 I thought I would give it a go. I am so happy with it. It is light, easy to manage over my floor rugs and floor boards, has great suction, easy to empty. Manages dog and cat fur with ease and has no clogging points. I haven’t found anything negative about it. Definitely can recommend"
98,5,Bissell helix upright vacumPurchased my Bissell helix vac from Harvey Norman a couple month's ago. Just love it. I'm a very fastidious person and had many vacs. Well this fellow kills them all.Being a age pensioner I couldn't afford to spend many hundreds. This machine cost me 199.00 and it's brilliant light weight so it's much easier for me to use and empty. I would highly recommend this product.
99,5,"Best vacuum cleaner I've ownedI use this on carpet and and ceramic tiles, and occasionally corners of ceiling or window sills etc. I was happy with my previous vacuum cleaner (a cordless Vax) but I accidentally broke that. It wasn't until I impulsively bought this Bissell one that I realised that the Vax hadn't been doing the job. I don't have any large areas of tiles, so I can't really comment on how well it works there, but on my carpet it's been perfect, the suction is powerful, and it has a large capacity to collect all the dust, hair and crumbs that I would not have thought was even on my floors! It has all the attachments I've needed and they are stored on the vacuum cleaner, which I like, to keep it all together, but easily removed when you need to use them. The cord is long but you only take as much as need to use. I don't find it to be noisy, unless I accidentally vacuum tiles or a low pile rug when on the carpet setting, or vice versa. It's easy to change between the settings. It's also easy to maintain and clean the filter. I'd definitely recommend this."
100,5,"Really impressedVery quick to put together. works great, I couldn't believe the amount of dust and hair that came out the carpet. Seems like a sturdy design, light & easy to use. Do not use on flimsy bath mats as the suction is so strong it will suck in the mat! IF this keeps working like this in a couple of years time - it will be the best vacuum cleaner I've ever used for carpet and pet hair! Love it. With the adjustable height for the power head was also very effective on tiles and wood floor."
101,5,"best Ive every boughtGreat for carpet deep clean
Very powerful suction
Great attachments
Wide motorised head
Strongest Ive ever seen. Ive worked with professional carry backs that professional cleaners use but they are nothing in comparison to the powerforce. The wide head means that you cover more area faster. Motorised brush is great for carpet."
102,5,"Great valueI purchased this vacuum cleaner because quite frankly it was cheap and it was all I could afford. For a $108 I was not expecting the world's greatest but I have been very impressed. I am cleaning low pile carpets which I thought were quite clean but was very surprised at the amount of dirt this cleaner got out of the carpets. Very, very easy to dismantle and clean as it is all plastic. I am not expecting it to last a lifetime but if it runs OK for a couple of years I will be very pleased. I also like the fact that it comes with two replacement belts."
103,5,"Gas pedal is on the wrong side for AUWorks well the suction is good, Small dust partials and dog hair.
I have Hyperacusis and use it with high performance earmuff's on.

The gas pedal is on the Left being it is the America's #1 brand, you have to kill the power if a thread pulls on old carpet you have to cross legs to switch off, but there is 2 replacement belts supplied I have not needed to use one had it 3-4 months.

I have large rooms of carpet and I find it easy to zip around the area.

Good value for the money.

Washable filter."
104,5,"Great productDoes the job, great picks up every thing best vacuum cleaner we have had.
A bit bulky in tight spaces generally does a very good job.

We are very happy with it."
105,5,"Absolutely love itHubby and I bought this cleaner to do the carpets and rugs in our disgusting rental property in April 2024. We have previously owned a Bissell carpet cleaner about 9-10 yrs ago and it survived 10 yrs of use every 3-6m including puppy training and living in a mining town (extreme dust and coal in the air).
The good:
- It reallllly cleans! First go every time. We tested it on our rentals carpets and its worked like a charm but the real star was our 3yr old extremely dirty long shagpile rug. It was brown and has come back to brand new grey tones! Super impressed.
- The brushes really scrub the carpets/rugs as it goes, rather than just spraying water on then sucking it off like a vacuume would. This thing gets reallly deep into the fibres with all the bristles resulting in your carpets being ""fluffed"" and super clean.
- Lifts even the most stubborn stains.
- Completely gets rid of smells and lingering stenches in carpets even if they've supposedly been cleaned only 6m ago. Our new rentals carpets were releasing this off curry/dirty/sweat/cumin type of smell and they've completely stopped since we used this machine.
- Easily sourced, we got ours on sale at Godfreys
- I love the handle shape, it really makes it easy to hold and use. Its a nice big loop that is easy to grab at any angle and suitable for those with arthritis in their hands etc.
- I like the cord wrapper on the back- makes it easy to store and contain the cord as you go you can just unfurl more as you need it- preventing you from tripping over it as you walk backwards.
- Bissell hasn't let us down before and seems to be a trusted brand, the cleaner is well made and seems great almost industrial quality.
- I like that it lights up on the bottom of the machine what mode you're on so you can easily see what setting you're set to and change quickly and easily. But that the button to do so is on the handle, which stops you needing to bend over to change the setting. Its a small thing, but its helpful.
- I really love that it steams as well as cleans. We really needed the steam function in this house and its absolutely disgusting what it's lifted out of carpets we were told were clean.
- Easy to use once you understand how to use it to its full potential.
- Easy to set up for that first time. Pretty self explanatory really.
- The chemicals it comes with really work! We accidently used less than half of the required amount and our carpets have still come out so so clean and smell fresh as a daisy! All marks and smells are gone!
- I like that the chemicals are very easily sourced Australia wide.
- I especially love the tray that goes under it. That it comes with the machine too. I love that this tray allows you to clean the machine after each use. It scrubs the brushes and then allows the machine to suck up the dirty water- preventing you from needing to carefully carry a tray full of dirty water through your house to the sink.
- The tanks are a pretty decent size. We got a whole 3mX2.5m room/rug done with each tank.
- When done properly, the carpets and rugs were dry in about 4-6hrs on a cool day.
-The added attachments like the hose and handle parts are so helpful. I can't wait to clean my lazyboy recliner. If the carpets and rugs are anything to go by, it should come back looking brand new like they have.
- I really appreciate the corner tool. Makes getting in the creases and corners so easy especially with things like stairs and car seats etc.

Things that could be better
- She's really loud... You're going to want hearing protection with this one.
- She's really heavy. This is not self propelled so I imagine it would likely be too heavy for those who are elderly or cannot lift and maneuver heavy items. Though, it is upright too, so it's not like moving a couch, its more like just a super heavy upright vacume. - And for the level of clean this machine gives it's well worth the weight of it. But that's just something that people should be aware of going into it.
- Making it self propelled like other machines on the market would make it much easier to handle.
- It'd be really handy and helpful if there was a tag or picture on the machine that teaches people how to actually get the most out of it. There are a lot of reviews here saying its flooding people's carpets, however that is 100% the fault of the operator not the machine. You need to go regular vacuming speed forward (or perhaps a smidge faster) and really slowly backwards sucking the water out. If you go too slowly forward of course its going to flood the carpet! Putting a little tag with pictures or steps on the handle like it has showing the assembly and modes would be very beneficial I think.
- In a perfect world, it'd have a retractable cord like a vacuume does but that's really nit picking I suppose.

Overall though we are absolutely blown away by the performance of this cleaner and will absolutely be recommending it to all our friends for their homes. Its definitely money well spent."
106,5,"PowerfulI have about 6 rugs all up throughout my house and it them all very well, also cleaned my car brilliantly as well. Very easy to use, self cleaning function is helpful too."
107,5,"Epic resultsThis machine removed stains my previous Hoover couldn't. Easy to use and clean, steam works really well. Controls in the handle are a nice touch. The quick dry mode had most of my place ready to walk on again in under an hour."
108,5,"Stick with a mop and bucket unless you have money to burnDoes a good job and floors are left pretty dry. Can do all my hard floors on a single charge. Does allow you to mop without vacuuming first - probably its biggest plus. Have to empty dirty water container once during a clean and at the end. There is still cleaning of parts/containers at the end. Don't bother with the expensive add-on cleaning fluids - they are not needed at all.
And if you stick with the mop and bucket Choice Magazine research indicates that all the various hard floor cleaning products perform worse that just plain hot water!"
109,5,"Big ImprovementAfter mops that just moved dirty water around the floor, we are happy with this cordless machine.
We live near the beach in tropical Queensland and we have shiny porcelain tiles throughout our flat. While light and bright, they show every mark. So this mop is not much different than using a cordless vacuum and does a very good job.

We bought the Bissell cleaning chemical with it. But would not buy the chemicals again, we find warm water gets the best results (see Choice magazine report).

So far, after about 4 months and used every second day, we are happy with this product."
110,5,"Bissell Bliss!How it All Began:
So, at the end of October 2019, my Wife and I were commenting on the ineffectiveness of floor moppers, sponge and other types and we happen to be in Harvey Norman at the time for something else and had a look on what was on offer for automated floor cleaners.

We observed an array of devices and I remembered someone at work had mentioned a brand called Bissell so we asked the sales person about it. The Bissell brand of floor and carpet cleaners were said to be one of the best with no customers returning a Bissell cleaner (so he said). We had a close inspection of what was on offer and saw they had the CrossWave Cordless Professional 2582H model and one that was out for demo.

I gave it quite an extended demo and thought this could be good. So, yes we bought it for a discounted price of $510.

Setting Up at Home:

Unboxing and setting up was relatively easy. The cleaner had a limited amount of parts: The body and handle, the water tank, the dirty water tank and the internal parts, the spinning brush roll and the brush roll window.

Once set up and after a full charge I filled up the water tank with hot water to the gauge level and topped it up with the Bissell hard floor cleaning solution - pretty easy.

I then pressed the hard floor button on top of the handle and the brush head sprung to life. To add the cleaning solution, you press the trigger handle underneath the main handle.

The device moves on wheels and for me it is light enough to operate one-handed.

The cleaner has a very handy stand tray which will capture any solution that may drip out after use. It also has little areas where you can put the attachments on - very well thought out.

First Run:

So I went over all the hard floors in the two bathrooms, two toilets, laundry and all the hardwood floors.

The cleaner has a handy battery indicator at the top of the body so I kept a careful eye on that. I probably spent a little extra time on each floor than I needed and used up the solution before I finished the final area, up the hallway back to the laundry.

First Results Impression:

The first thing I noticed was how much cleaner all surfaces looked, especially the polished wooden floors - looked shinier. The grouting on the bathroom floors were much cleaner, as if they had been manually scrubbed with a brush.

The cleaner also picked up some dog hair that I missed in vacuuming, which just made everything that much more cleaner.

The cleaner was easy to get into almost all places - everywhere a normal pad-type mop can get to.

Dismantling and cleaning is exceptionally simple. For the parts that come off; you just take them off and rinse them off in hot water.

The few bits of pet hair pull right out of the bottom area behind the roller and the tube at the bottom of the dirty water container.

6 Months Later:

Now I've got my method down-pat; I clean all the hard floors and still have two out of three lights left on the battery indicator and I have just a little cleaning solution left.

I have noticed that on some occasions when I have taken a bit longer in some areas that the battery lasts longer so it appears the more you use it; the longer the charge remains in the battery.

Overall, I believe the Bissell cleaner has made my house cleaner and more hygienic, as it is quite a powerful and thorough device. It picks up what is missed in vacuuming.

Final Thoughts:

A very well thought out robust machine.

Would I recommend it: Yes, absolutely.

Does it improve the cleaning process: Yes - with both ease of use and excellent results.

Areas for improvement: Slightly bigger water containers and battery because some days you want to clean areas longer that are dirtier than usual, especially in the wet and wintry seasons.

If I were to rate it: 4 out of 5.

Last words:

Near perfect.

Bissell: - if you have a newer and improved model: I'd be happy to try it out.

This has been another Ant Review. I hope you have enjoyed reading it as much as I have enjoyed compiling it.

111,5,"2 in one floor cleaner does the job!Vacuum cleaner and mop in one. Gotta love a machine that cuts your cleaning time in half
I use this with ease on my 3 bedroom one bathroom house with floorboards. the tank needs to be filled twice. The waste tank needs to be emptied twice. It takes a special cleaning liquid mixed with water. I buy the solution when on sale.
Being cordless you don’t have to drag around a cord. Battery lasts for the whole house. It’s quick to recharge too.
It’s fiddly to clean the parts. But I can see how much dirt it pulls out of the boards."
112,5,"Used on the hybrid flooring ok and cleanI have a friend used tineco s3 and i have tried s3 as well. I found the fucntion less complicated than tineco s3 (fancy lcd) and price point is cheaper than tineco s3. HF3 clean the floor as well as the s3, can't tell the different and HF3 clean well. Once finished mopping the floor, clean out the dirty dush/hair/debris from the roller, empty dirty watertank , fill up clean water tank, run 4 x self-clean (good and clean for the roller), take out all the part and rise with clean water and let it dry, dry time for roller can be longer as it thick fibre.
The only down side for now, Bissell haven't respond my email over 2 weeks about purchasing a new extra roller for my HF3, and I couldn't find the roller on the market for the HF3.
"
113,5,Much better than the Bissell crosswave pet proAfter having to replace my corded Bissell crosswave pet pro under warranty as it stopped working to the hf3 model o am impressed. The battery life was long enough to do my entire house. The only down side is you have to vacuum first for best results. And even the minimal collecting of debris gets caught up at the back of the roller. Even on cleaning cycle there is still a small amount of dirt and fur . Other than that a much improved model from Bissell
114,5,"Effective carpet and rug cleaner for small areasI needed a carpet cleaner to remove and deep clean food, drinks, vomit, urine, foot traffic and dust out from my carpets. The cleaner is pretty intuitive to use - fill up the clean tank with warm water and Bissell solution, unlock the upright stand with the foot pedal, spray the solution back and forth and repeat again to extract the solution from the carpet. The slower you go, the better the results. The amount of dirt that can be collected in the dirty tank is unbelievable - even after a thorough powerhead vacuum. It does good job with new stains and also old stains if you use Bissell Oxyboost additive and pre-treatment. The water extraction is efficient and carpets dry in 2-3 hours. Cleaning the head is easy enough as the extraction nozzle clips off and roller brush comes out with one screw for a rinse. It works well on flat rugs and low pile rugs, but no experience with shaggy rugs. It will also work on chairs if they're flat.
Only downsides are the slight leaks during use (keep it on a towel when standing upright), the clumsy emptying of the dirty water tank and small capacity of the clean tank which means you have to rinse and refill frequently, even for a small room. However this is only designed for small jobs and I can easily see a bigger tank as adding unneeded weight. That's why Bissell made the ProHeat x2 and Big Green for larger areas."
115,5,"Great vaccum for the price!I bought this as a secondary vaccum and didn't hold out much hope for it given the price but I'm actually really impressed. For the price this stick vaccum has good suction, picks up dog hair no problem, easy to empty (which I love) and vaccums really really well. Also has a light so you can see dirt, hair etc. I'm actually going to buy one for my sister. The only thing I would say is, it is a wee bit heavy but other than that, I love it and I would highly recommend! So much better than the Dyson I had"
116,5,"After weeks research picked the right vac for now....,Had for two weeks. Got it for $278 with 20% off sale good guys. Way better than Dyson replacing. Quieter. Head doesn't get tangled with long hair. Heavier unit but now use to it. Not adjustable wand but didn't need."
117,5,"Best cordless stick vacuum ever!!!Best cordless vacuum cleaner I’ve ever had! I use it on thick rugs, floor tiles and timber floors. Leaves no marks, glides over the floors without any delay! It’s quite too so I can get the housework done without waking up everyone! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
118,5,"Love this product - absolute time saverWe have 4 little dogs, so I was desperate to find something to cut down my cleaning time.
I don’t tend to use on our carpets as I use our Bissell ProHeat, but I use the Crosswave on our porcelain tiles and rugs. It does a great job, is easy to use and leaves the house smelling really fresh. It vacuums and mops in one go and I never have to touch up any left over hair etc. TIP: To avoid streaking make sure you do not put too much product in."
119,5,"Great for dog ownersWe have a fully carpeted house and frequently foster dogs for animal rescue so it can be a bit of a mess at times.
The Bissel Crosswave does a great job of cleaning the floors and handles most stains with a once over pass. The water tanks do need changing quite a bit compared to a commercial carpet cleaner and it’s fairly heavy to push when it’s on but that’s because of its powerful suction. It’s also pretty loud, louder than a vacuum cleaner.
It’s important that unless you are tackling a wet stain that you vacuum first to get the best results. So far it’s been able to handle all the fluids that a puppy can accidentally leave on the floor.
All around it’s an excellent machine for its price if you need to regularly clean your carpets.
One star off because if you are in a rush and forget to empty the waste tank it can leak a little."
120,5,"Good value for its priceHappy with our purchase. Although a bit loud, our previous one (different brand) has been way worse. We find this better for its price. Power is good as well. This does its job. Has a few different bits and pieces for vacuuming couch and small spaces which I find it great. Had it for around 6 months already and nil issues on short circuits.
One downside is it's not wireless but would not complain for its price. Also we just find when vacuuming our rug that due to its motor power, it sucks the rug most of the time. We do have those shaggy type rugs in the living. However, nil issues on timber floors. So far, we are happy with this purchase."
121,5,brillentbought yesterday very easy to put together just have to attach handle im in a caravan with hard anex carpet hasn't been cleaned properly in 20 years the amount of dirt pulled from the carpet was amazing i filled the 1 litre dirt catcher to the top on the first clean on the second pass it was half litre of dirt the vacuum is loud but worth it
122,5,"A great machine. Pleasure to usePurchased two weeks ago and have been amazed at how well this machine has performed. Used on carpet only so far and it has brought up so much fine grit I would never have thought was in the carpet. Carpet looks better, especially in the tracking areas, and has come up feeling softer. Easy to use, empty and clean filters. Would highly recommend this product. A joy to vacuum the house."
123,5,"AlrightGood suction, wide head, turbo head is good it does make pushing easier, it feels like it pulls it forward when head is turned on which is another good function to turn on and off. Love the led lights. A little bulky but ok. Only used it once so I'll keep you posted of performance and reliability. Sticker was $399 retail at Harvey Norman and only paid $369"
124,5,"Great VacuumGot this recently to replace our previous brand that we thought was pretty good.
We are very impressed with this. Comes with 3 vacuum heads, one Turbo with revolving brush for carpets, another with a brush for hard floors and a normal for both as well as smaller accessories attachments.
All filters are washable too.
It is for its size, which is small, a bit weightier than our previous one, but tells the motor is a seriously well built and a good one and proving itself to be so. Noise wise it starts off soft, builds up in several seconds but is not anything over the top. Just loud enough to let you know it's got some serious power.
All the heads work great for what they are for.
We are really happy with it. Just a few sweeps over the carpet showed it picking up more than we expected to see in the barell.
Yeah it's capacity litre wise is smaller than some but the job it does is wonderful.
We have zero regrets with this.
Comes with everything you need.
Two thumbs up.
From some reviews, forget influencer ones they are rubbish, but from, I say, some supposed verified buyers, we read that taking the cleaner barell off was difficult, and the top to clean the filters. But we have not found that to be so at all. My misses with her bad wrist from a failed operation can do it, and she has issues with lots of things. So the stories of how hard it is, to me, is rubbish from competitors.
Follow the instructions and its easy as!
Very good Vacuum."
125,5,It’s the secret to my spotless houseI am obsessed with Bissell Crosswave. Its cleans the floors picking up all the bits and bobs of food or whatever and at the same time mopping the floors clean. The dirty water doesn’t mix with the clean water. The self cleaning part has to the cherry on top. Highly recommend it.
126,5,"Ease of set up great on tilesPurchased BISSELL clean view, we have a dog and the daily vacuum was becoming a chore for my husband, he brought this robot vacuum and today’s it’s done exactly what it says it does, so as far as hubby concerned job done, programs it to start early morning so house looks cleaner"
127,5,Great long lasting vacI've had this for at least 7 years and it's still going strong. The battery is diminished and the bristles are worm down but it still cleans as well as it did when I first bought it.
128,5,"Most Preferred little suckerCompared to my other more Expensive vacuum,my BOSCH is the most comfortable to use and most preferred for reliable for battery life. I will purchase another for each end of the home."
129,5,"Fantastic vacuum cleanerPurchased the Bosch cordless vacuum from The Good Guys for $199. It has 3 speeds & transitions well from tiles onto carpet without a change in the dials. The battery life is quite long compared to other makes & brands. The machine is relatively lite in weight & moving it around into tight spaces is easy. It's bagless which is cost effective & has washable filters that can also be replaced after heavy use. Charging from zero to full does take a few hours, this is the only down fall I've found since purchasing it."
130,5,I love this stick vacuumIt is so light and has fantastic suction on both tiles and carpet wouldn’t buy anything else
131,5,"Love my BoschThis is my 2nd Bosch Vacuum cleaner. I love how its solid & not flimsy. Have had this particular one for 2 years, my only frustration is the battery is now only lasting 7minutes when fully charged!"
132,5,"Great vac, sucks up the dog hair very wellIf you have any cordless Lithium-Ion battery vac including this Bosch, I STRONGLY recommend you do NOT leave it plugged in on charge all the time. If you do leave it plugged in on charge all the time you will damage the batteries and they'll lose capacity very quickly. Use it till it's nearly flat *then* charge it, and most importantly unplug it after it's charged. If you do this, the batteries should last many hundreds of cycles (i.e. years).
Have had this vacuum for about 4 months now; very happy with it so far. We're using it mainly as a second vac, on tiled and laminated flooring, with a little carpet and rugs. Works great on all these surfaces - picks up the dog hair without fuss on the first pass, on the ""regular"" power setting which is quieter than our main Dyson. As we're only using it for 5-10 minutes at a time the battery lasts ages between charges. It's also easy to empty the dirt chamber."
133,5,"Great cordless vacuum cleanerThis was a test purchase to see if this vacuum cleaner would suit our household compared to the good old pull along model we have had for years. It does what the marketing spiel says it will and better. So much so, we bought a second one (the Bosch Athlet 25.2V White BCH6AT25AU) for our parents home. The old pull along vacuum hasn't been used since. This cordless vacuum cleaner has a lithium ion battery that lasts well and three settings to allow extra suction when necessary or on light suction for a quick sweep over the tiled floor. You can park it anywhere and it stays upright and out of the way. The head swings sideways so you swivel the handle to can get underneath chairs, beds etc and not miss anything. Cleaning the filters is quick and easy, as is cleaning the sweeper head brush and it lets you know when it's time to empty. We have a small dog and chose the Zoo'o ProAnimal model to manage the hair situation - again, the product performs superbly as promised. Charging doesn't take too long and the best thing about the lithium ion battery is you can charge enough to finish a task and plug it back in to finish charging, without impacting the life of the battery. As I said, we love it so much we bought a second one. I have read elsewhere that some people have found it hard to push on high suction but I found it great exercise and reassuring that the carpet/rugs were getting a good ""do over"". Very impressed. Highly recommended."
134,5,"3.5 product, 5 stars for customer serviceGood vacuum used for carpet and floorboards. Have had for 2 and a bit years. Roller on the head piece stopped spinning ($160 to replace). Dealt with parts department and customer service @ Bosch. Parts department were friendly, and customer service woman (Jan?) was absolutely outstanding. Resolved the issue for me. I don't know what the lifetime expectancy of vacuums is these days, but 2 years (4 months) seems short... so from a product perspective, 3 stars, and from a resolution and service perspective - flawless. Thank you!"
135,5,"This is a well built and great performing vacWe purchased this vac from Harvey Normans about 4 years ago. It runs perfectly, sucks up dirt and grime like you would not believe and has performed without a hitch. Because we live in a 2 storied house my wife purchased a top line Dyson 2 years ago - one for each floor. The Dyson cost twice as much as the Bosch and, while another great Dyson product, it is not really any better than the Bosch. The major difference is that the Dyson motor and dust collection are up at the top so you have to carry that weight. The Bosch has all the weight lower down and so it is not heavy in the same sense that the Dyson is.
Both good products but always consider this Bosch. It is a great and reliable machine. "
136,5,"Cordless ease and great suctionI've had this vacuum for two years and the suction was so much better than my Dyson. What I love the most most is the cordless feature as I live in a town house with two sets of stairs. No more dragging cords up flights of stairs behind me and always switching power points! I note that some people say that the suction fades. It does but if you clean the filter once or twice a month, the suction is regained. I do a lot of vacuuming so I maintain this vacuum cleaner well. It is also important to clean out the head as it doesn't take long for this to become clogged with hair etc.
I did have one major problem with it. The handle snapped about a month ago ... but Bosch have agreed to replace the whole unit so I'm very happy with that.
That problem aside, (perhaps I was just unlucky), I'd say this is a very good purchase."
137,5,"Good vacuumThe vacuum moves well between different surfaces like tiles and carpet. Good suction level on turbo mode but the battery runs out quite quickly.
The handle cracked while vacuuming my carpet but Bosch were kind enough to offer a replacement."
138,5,"Just loving thisI am just loving my Bosch Vacuum, it’s so easy and handy to use. With full charge I can do my whole house on middle setting. I was amazed when I use this first time and how nicely it took all dirt away, once we played Holi (Indian festival played with colours) my alfresco was full of colours and I was surprised with the cleaning what this vacuum did, My friends got impressed too. Also it picks up the dirt from corners too. So happy with it."
139,5,This is great! Wonderful customer serviceLove this vacuum. Our first one was over a year old when it stopped sucking effectively. After showing Bosch they replaced it with a new one! Excellent company to deal with.
140,5,Battery dies after 5 minutesWe bought the Bosch Athlet about 2.5 years ago and it performed well except for the last few months where the battery power has become shorter and shorter. It now lasts for 5 minutes at the most. This is disappointing in view of Bosch's reputation for excellence. Otherwise we have found that the vacuum performs well.
141,5,"Absolutely love it .... butAbsolutely love this, I have 2 one upstairs and one down .... but the downstairs one although fully charged, cuts out after 2 mins. Very disappointing as these are the best I’ve ever had. I’ve had this one for about a year"
142,5,"Some good, some bad pointsI have owned the Bosch Athlet for four years now. There are points about it that I like and some I don't. Here is what I like: the battery life is good. The original battery is still working with enough capacity to clean the house. The machine is light and the suction is sufficient. Negatives: Small stones can get caught in the brush drive, which makes it significantly noisier. I actually bought a new brush head after three years. The detachable handle can break easily if your kid decides to use it as a witches broom."
143,5,Perfect little vacuum goes anywhereMy lg is fantastic it goes anywhere and does my hardwood floors faster and more battery life and I can get the whole house done on one battery
144,5,"Purrfect for pet ownersWhen I got tired of dragging my regular heavy vacuum around and decided to give a stick a try, I went for a cheaper brand thinking if I didn’t like it I wouldn’t loose out much. Such a rookie error! I wish I would have just purchased the LG CordZero A9 to start with. I have polished floors throughout and with 4 cats they can sometimes look like I have a few fur rugs!
The CordZero is so light and easy for me to handle, I have a shoulder injury and have had no problems vacuuming the whole house in one go.
Never had to swap batteries mid clean and having the extra battery on hand just in case is a bonus.
It has great suction on the timber floors, picks up everything without leaving marks or scratches as my previous vac did.
Stacks away neatly in a corner of the spare room.
The only two negatives I have is that I find it a little tricky getting tangled hair from the roller, I usually have to use scissors and it is a lot noisier than I thought it would be.
I do love it and would highly recommend to anyone looking to try a stick vacuum."
145,5,"LG Cord Zero Handstick Vac Multi (A9N-Multi)Context
I have owned a couple of Dyson stick vacuums. I also previously owned the Dreame T30 which I thought was better than the Dyson. I was happy with the Dreame as it had good performance, multiple accessories and you could also get an extra battery for longer use. Unfortunately, the battery that came with it stopped working within 12 months. Hence, I was on the search for a new stick vacuum. After reading lots of reviews I settled on the LG Cord Zero Multi.
As I have robot vaccums, the LG Multi is mainly used for getting into areas where the robot can’t go, doing the stairs, small ad-hoc cleaning and also handheld applications. Features that were important to me were batter life, suction and the ability to pick up pet litter and having different accessories for different cleaning jobs (I had gotten use to those because of the inclusions that Dreame T30 had).

It is used on hard flooring, rugs, lounge chairs and soft furnishings.

Overview
I had the LG Cord Zero handstick Multi delivered to my home. It comes well packaged.
It comes with a multi surface nozzle, hard floor nozzle, 2 batteries, a dock that can be floor standing or attached to a wall and a few different tools (combination, crevice,

Pros
- good suction performance. Works well on area rugs and hard flooring.
-Comes with 2 batteries as standard. One on the vacuum and the other sits on the docking station and both charge at the same time.
-good battery life. Using different suction levels helps extend battery life further. Turbo does drain the battery
-you don’t have to hold down the power button or a trigger for continuous usage
-easy button push to open flap to empty vacuum
-easy to adjust the length of the telescopic pipe if member of your household vary in height
-ability to wall mount or use in floor standing mode depending on your preference. I initially used the floor standing mode and it works well. Have since wall mounted.
-easy to manoeuvre and reasonably lightweight
-availability of additional tools to purchase.

Cons
-not great with large debris. It will pick up cat litter but the large pellet kind or large cat biscuits it doesn’t pick up as an example.
-not enough storage for the tools that come with it. You will need to find an alternative storage solution. I use a plastic tub to keep them together as I purchased extra tools anyway.
-as a multi cat household we do pick up a lot of pet hair. As its lightweight it doesn’t fall out when emptying. I think this is partly due to the width of the cannister. It can be a little fiddly to pull out manually. This wasn’t a problem I experienced with other brands.
- some of the additional tools do feel overpriced for what they are.

Tips
- Removing the floor base once installed was a bit tricky so probably better to not set up the floor mount initially if you want to wall mount the stick vacuum in the long run.
-if you want to buy the extra tools, then better to buy the flexi tool kit (or total care kit) for $87 which has 5 tools rather than buying individual parts. As an example the flexible cord sells for $50 and the angle tool sells for $30 from statewide appliances. So for an extra $7 you get 3 other tools including when buying the flexi kit.
- I also purchased the mini drive nozzle as an extra tool. It does a good job of picking up pet hair. I keep that for using on soft furnishings only so I’m not transferring germs from the floor or other surfaces onto the soft furnishings.

Would I recommend
Yes I would recommend this item. I’d choose this over a Dyson stick vacuum."
146,5,"Excellent for a small houseI needed a small yet effective stick vac for my small house. I have no carpet, just one very flat floor rug and hardwood or tiles elsewhere. I have a cat who is sending off more furballs than I can handle at the moment. This little vac does a great job getting into small spaces and comes with plenty of attachments as well as an extra battery. I've yet to run out of battery power even when using it on turbo power.
It's easy to take apart and clean, which is a bonus because my small handheld portable vac is a pain to pull apart. The filters can be washed which is good because I don't need to buy more.

It works very well on all my floors, even my little rug.

Highly recommend this vacuum."
147,5,"New found freedomLight weight and the 2 batteries are great.. It is also very good for removing pet hair..
My only reservation is the fact that one has to make sure all the bits are sucked into the holder or there will be a small pile left behind .
Other than that l really like the option of no cord and bending over and pulling of a big vacuum cleaner.."
148,5,"A new experience of the best kindI had many cordless Vacuum cleaners before, but not one can compare to the LG cord zero A9K-AQUA. 1. Easy to use, 2. Easy to empty ( really easy) , 3 . Brilliant suction 4. Comes with 2 battery's and both can be charged together. 5. Has a rotation floor mop, absolutely brilliant for my floor boards, tiles and slate floors. I have the Vacuum now over 4 months and still be thrilled."
149,5,Perfect for daily cleaningHas been a fabulous helper. Bought it for suction and mop option (considered dyson but they don’t have the mop option at the time) and I am very satisfied. Use mop for hard floors and vacuum on carpet and both always comes up clean. Various attachments also makes life easier for different types of cleaning. Fouble batteries works wonders.
150,5,"Best vacuum I have ownedI love my LG vacuum.
The best features are:
The suction - three suctions. The most powerful picks up my huskies hair from the carpet. Battery lasts long too.
Compact dirt - the handle on the side pushes the dirt down so you can continue vacuuming without having to empty often.
Two batteries- the tower even has space to store the battery so they are both fully charged. Especially if you use the power suction.
The tower - automatic emptying. Saves time and I love that you place it on the tower and it does the job for you.
It is not as noisy as other vacuums.
My husband wasn’t sure about LG because he likes the Dyson but he has been converted."
151,5,"It’s a decent product but without the WOW factor!Got my first cordless stick vacuum cleaner and wasn’t sure what exactly to expect. It cleans dust well, is easy to handle, light weight, has good battery life and is easy to store. However, the suction power isn’t great for other bits on the floor and you’d have to pick that up manually. Rest, love the fact that there’s no wiring to be mindful of when cleaning up which is the best aspect and I am never going back to the regular vacuum cleaners."
152,5,"awesome excellentfantastic product easy to use, picks everything up, highly recommend this product"
153,5,I love itI love this LG CORDZERO it is really fabulous for picking up my 2 dogs malting hair. LG life’s good.
154,5,"Two batteries for the price of oneFantastic value. Light easy to use (way better than heavy Dysons). But best of all you get two batteries. Given battery life is THE biggest issue with stick vacs and given alternating batteries is the best way to extend their life this is like getting two vacuums for the price of one as this will basically double the usable life of the machine. Well engineered, very well thought out. Beats all machines within $500 of its price point hands down!"
155,5,"Power Saver!!I love how it cleans the surface (even the dust, hair, and fur, for example), and even though it only uses 600W, it still significantly reduces my energy costs."
156,5,"super effective and reliableWorth purchasing, light weight, 2 batteries, great suction, easy cleaning."
157,5,"2 year review - still the best cordless stick for $399I have had the A9 White for almost 2 years and use it daily as the main household vacuum. Far better than my old Vax Blade which was $100 less. Great suction and pickup even on the lowest setting (total 3 settings), very lightweight, quiet, low vibration, battery lasts 20 minutes, filters are removable in seconds (comes with 2 yellow pre-motor plus 1x HEPA top lid), removable battery, wall charging dock and the brush roll never ever tangles with hair. Only downside is the average pickup on hard floors which needs a fluffy floorhead (sold separately). The dust bin is harder to empty when it's very full but you can use the crevice tool to twist and remove the internal metal filter and shake it out, no skin contact with dust.
The other reviews show breakage and weird smells but that's probably user error (how is a weird smell the fault of LG? Open and clean your vacuum) or maybe a bad batch. My A9 is does not have any broken bits, only scratches on the wand and floorhead. Even the battery still holds charge well after 2 years. I use my A9 several times a day, 7 days a week as a main household vacuum on carpet and tiles so much heavier duty than expected and it's still fine.

So after nearly 2 years, the battery hold good charge, the filters have just been replaced due to slight loss of suction and the brush roller head has never tangled with hair or fur. Nothing electrical or mechanical has failed. So overall a great vacuum for $399."
158,5,"This is fabulousI bought this stick vacuum after reading lots of reviews. Our Dyson just wasn't up to it anymore and we had had to replace quite a few parts over time - and some in the early days of owning it so I wanted to get a different brand. I love the tower concept. Everything is tidied away and out of sight. The barrel emptying system is fantastic and quite alarming the first time due to the quick startup and sound. The actual stick does a terrific job on the carpet and has pulled out a huge amount of cat hair, dust etc., even after it was vacuumed using an upright. It really is great. My husband loves using it. I bought one for my daughter as well and she also loves it. We have had a few months now and still haven't used up the first bag in the tower so they must hold a fair bit. Anyway, we love the effectiveness of this vacuum. Fingers crossed it continues."
159,5,"Needs better hard floor toolExcellent vacuum especially with my back except it scratches glossy tiles when using on hard floors with hard floor tool
Can LG improve this tool so that only the roller makes contact across tiles and not click clack and possibly scratching tiles?"
160,5,"Love the A9. Hate hurting my fingers on battery removalBattery is too hard to change. Beware if you have long finger nails! Can barely press the buttons to release battery. Need butter knife something to wedge in to pop off battery.
My acrylics ripped nail off"
161,5,"Only wish I’d bought it earlier!Very happy with my purchase! I use it multiple times daily mostly on laminate wood flooring, one room with textured tiles, and carpet in the bedrooms. Great battery life, it’s not run out on me yet (modest 3 bed home).
It’s very quiet, however that’s no indication of the performance. It’s better than anything I’ve owned previously and no longer require a corded vacuum. The design and features were very well thought out; From every attachment having a place on the tower, to the vacuum heads that reach right to the edges. I find it performs well on every surface and is very easy to manoeuvre around the home.

The mop attachment won’t replace my regular floor cleaner but it’s so convenient for spot cleaning smaller spills or mud tracked in the front door and still gets a work out.
It’s also very easy to pull apart and clean as everything is designed to come apart easily. The auto empty feature is convenient and the bags last quite a long time, although I have found it does produce a dusty smell after use.

Overall I’m incredibly happy with the purchase and highly recommend to anyone who will listen!"
162,5,"Great product!This product has changed my life. With two young children, it's made cleaning so much more manageable. Having the option to simultaneously mop and vacuum has been an absolute winner here with floors being done in virtually half the time! "
163,5,"Cleaning out the brush headCan you open up the head of the nozzle unit - the red one designed for cleaning animal hair? The bit with rotating brushes. Mine seems to be jammed, probably hair, can’t work out how to clean it out."
164,5,Has performed well for the last 9 yearsIt has been the best and quietest vacuum we have owned. It's unbelievable how much it gets out of carpet you think it's already clean. We replaced all the filters about 3 years just for hygiene and still working like the day we got it. Every now and then it gets a bit pedantic with the shelf clean so we wash the filter with cold water and a scrubbing brush and it works fine again after letting it dry properly.
165,5,one of the best & quietest vacuumsThis is a powerful vac. The only problem is that it's over pedantic on cleaning itself to maintain maximum suction. It can be frustrating waiting 10seconds for the cleaning mode every 1 to 2 minutes when trying to clean a quick mess. It is however strong and very quiet.
166,5,"Best vacuum ever!This vacuum cleaner has been an absolute power horse. Not only have I had no issues with it mechanically, this vacuum cleaner’s performance at picking up dust and dirt is second to none. I had a Dyson before it, and hands down the Bosch does a better job at picking up dust and dirt and other things from the floor. The suction is always super strong, even when the bagless filter is near full. I’ve had it for nearly five years now and cannot fault it. I will definitely buy another Bosch vacuum over Dyson any day! The Harvey Norman salesperson I bought it from was desperate for me to buy another Dyson and didn’t even show me the Bosch. When I spotted it as an alternative to Dyson, the salesperson really tried hard to brush off the Bosch and convince me to stick with the Dyson, which only made me want to try the Bosch even more, and boy am I glad I did! Thank you Bosch!"
167,5,"Best vacuum clear, strong and quietIt has been worked for me 7 years. I’m looking to buy same one. Strong suction and soooo quite. I vacuum while my baby was sleeping. You won’t regret with this vacuum cleaner"
168,5,"Awesome!Super quiet, quality build, great suction... I bought this 2nd hand and missing the main hoovering attachment... So I bought a universal carpet attachment and haven't looked back! I've heard all the horror stories about this same model turning on the ""Self cleaning mode"" almost every 5 mins etc but I've had zero problems.. Maybe its all about the universal carpet attachment I bought as this one's got greater airflow than the stock Bosch one? Greater airflow = less ""Self cleaning"" sensitivity to blockage /Air restriction issues which activates the cleaning mode? Regardless its been a perfect vacuum cleaner..  "
169,5,"Powerful performanceWell engineered and very powerful. We use it on carpet, tiles and floor boards. The power head attachment is so easy to clean due to the cleaver - easy to remove brush head. Only small criticism is the power head stalls / slows down sometimes as it is driven from the suction of the vacuum rather than its own motor in the head itself. The self cleaning filter is brilliant as I always forgot to clean our old filter. Huge bag less compartment which is easy to empty and reinstall. Very happy."
170,5,"Very powerful and very quiet, but not perfect-=The Good=-
The first thing I noticed using this was how AMAZINGLY quiet it it. With the suction turned to the mildest level you could easily carry on a conversation without even noticing that the vacuum is on. You can have a coherent conversation even with it turned all the way to max (although obviously, it's louder), so it's ideal if you want to do some late-night vacuuming or generally hate the din of a noisy vacuum, or don't want to disturb people in a neighbouring room. I must say, having a quiet vacuum genuinely makes vacuuming much less of a chore, something I really hadn't thought of before I owned this unit. It's probably pretty good news if you've got pets or younguns that are terrified of vacuum sounds too.
The second thing I noticed was how crazy powerful the suction is compared to my old beater. I initially made the mistake of using the Parquetry head on a rug - it sucks so powerfully it will carry the rug with it, even when dialled down to half-suction! But more impressively, when you use the correct head (the carpet head) even on maximum suction it will easily glide over rugs and carpets giving them a good deep clean. The quasi-motorised carpet head also does a great job of picking up hair from carpets, and they have made it easy to clean the hair roller by simply removing it and cutting the bundled up hair with scissors, and you can remove it all in one go. Not sure how it would go with shorter animal hair, but it does a great job with long human hair. These little self-maintenance additions are sure to extend the useful life of the vacuum.

It comes with all the specialist attachments you could use, and even has a hybrid one that you can switch via a foot-lever from carpet-mode to parquetry mode; and has an attachment to the stick that carries the crevice tool and the upholstery attachment for portable convenience. The parquetry head works impressively well on hardwood floors - it will even pick up thin films of dried out mud, owing to the bristle action. All of the attachments are easy to attach and remove with quick-release catches - you never need to struggle wringing the thing back and forth to take an attachment off. It has two different mounts for the stick for when the vacuum is not in use - one with the vacuum in normal position and another if you wish to stand the vacuum up in a closet or some such. The hose is a high-quality nylon fabric hose and you can see by it's girth that this thing sucks a lot of air if you dial up the action.

It's easy to clean the debris compartment and also pretty easy to clean the filter if you wish to do this manually - I've done it by removing the filter and hitting it with the leaf blower and also compressed air, which works even better; however it has an auto-clean function built into it which will rapidly vibrate the internal dust filter to shake debris from it. This function can be enabled manually but apparently will also operate automatically if the vacuum detects poor suction (although in 6 months of use, mine never did it automatically).

-=The Not So Good=-
1. It's a bit on the heavy side which might be an issue if you're frail or you need to lug it up and down a staircase, but won't be for the average user or anyone with a house they can just drag it around in. I feel the heaviness results from a generally solid build quality; I've had cheaper, lighter vacuums but the plastic always ends up breaking apart on them.

2. I recently encountered a massive loss of suction from my unit which had me stumped for a few days. After pulling it apart, cleaning everything obvious the issue was still there, even with all the hoses cleaned out and filters freshly cleaned. Through a lot of experimentation I figured out the motor is still sucking like Tony Abbott as a PM, so I was almost out of ideas; and through chance I discovered that if I press upon the unit while it is turned on, the suction suddenly returned - turns out that a circular rubber gasket had gone missing from one of the suction ports above the debris container. This gasket is not indicated at all on the Bosch website as a spare part - although it's larger neighbour gasket is listed. So I took a trip to Bunnings and Macgyvered up my own gasket using some tubular self-adhesive weather seal (for $11), and bam - back to 100% suction again.

I had noticed that particular gasket came loose earlier when I was emptying the debris, and probably it happened again to someone else who emptied it and it went out with the trash. So I'm hoping they will send me a replacement and this time for good measure I'll probably glue it in place. I would have given it 5/5 for build quality if it weren't for this issue; everything else about it feels sturdy, built to last and built for regular use.

-= Conclusion =-
I genuinely love this vacuum, and it's worlds better than the cheapies I have owned in the past. The support from Bosch on the missing gasket has so far been very good; I was basically offered an entire replacement vacuum, but since I REALLY needed this vacuum to work to cleanup after a party I temporarily fixed it myself. Hopefully they still send me the gasket. It's not a cheap vacuum, but I feel I got what I paid for."
171,5,"Just awesome & very quietI have never thought that it might be so quiet vacuum cleaner. I was simply shocked when I switched it on for the first time.
Using it on tiles and carpet with no issues.
Washable container is very big -- perfectly fit our house. Vacuum is also big so might be not very handy for someone.
Long power cord is good addition. And cord's retractor works fine.

A bit expensive. We expected to buy something cheaper at the beginning. "
172,3,Not impressed at allDoesn't have a suction my previous Dyson vacuum cleaner had for half the price with a cord. The battery looses power very quickly. Quicker than what the item is designated to do.
173,3,"Not as good as the older modelsI brought the new Dyson V15 vacuum cleaner with high hopes it would be as good as the previous model. I was very disappointed as it doesn’t pick up small items as good as it should also the suction is very poor. Would I recommend this product no, would I buy another Dyson vacuum no I wouldn’t"
174,3,Laser just a gimmickIf you have alot of natural light in your house you wont even see the laser. Much prefer my outsize
175,3,"Disappointed no suction using crevice tool on Dyson V8 absoluteWhen using crevice too or dusting tool there is no suction it won’t clean out around window frames and doesn’t get dust off skirting boards, this is most disappointing to me."
176,3,"Not the best but far from the worstGreat vacuum for smaller tasks, eg quick carpet cleaning, floating floors or car cleaning. Not great for bigger projects. Batteries are a serious issue but can be easily replaced. They have a great wall mount with easy charging but it seems if you leave it on 24/7 it effects battery life."
177,3,"Average and disappointingMy 6 year old Dyson V6 died and the customer service to sort this out was great. They couldn't fix it so offered me a very good deal over the phone for a new V8 with all the accessories instead ($400).
Overall this is ok but very disappointing for what I would expect to be a considerably better vaccum cleaner.
In short, normal suction is very poor and often not enough to clean some basic things that you would think it should. The more powerful ""Max"" mode does the job which is fine but it only last 7 minutes. This means most of the time it lasts 7 minutes but then needs almost 6 hours to recharge before I can use it again - VERY FRUSTRATING!
I got this for a reasonably good deal but it's not even worth the price I paid.
Easy to set up & use and normal run time is ok but I need to use ""Max"" mode all the time so it only lasts 7 mins!
Good power head & accessories (but previous accessories from previous model won't work on new models)
Lightweight & easy to handle
Fairly low noise for normal use but ""Max"" mode required almost all the time is the usual loud noise"
178,3,"Great when it worksGood suction, love the cordless aspect however it worked really well for 6 months then the battery died, replaced the battery. Then it only worked for 1 to 2 minutes even tho fully charged.. wouldn't purchase another one."
179,3,"High hopesI had really high hopes for this product but unfortunately it didnt pass the check. The battery dies extremely fast and isn't strong enough. Would only recommend for small places with light dust, not a whole household."
180,3,"Poor battery lifeLike other reviewers, I can only get 10 minutes of battery life on carpet, on high setting with a fully clear dust/fur catcher. It is still only 6 months old. This was bought for us as a gift due to our Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal Plus having inadequate suction to remove dog hair from carpet. Unfortunately 2 strikes for Dyson......... you know the rest. Such a shame when a product fails to deliver on its brand promise!"
181,3,"Not happy with Dyson advanced V7Purchased the Dyson Advanced V7 stick vacuum approximately 15 months ago & I find it won't keep charge for very long, gets blocked easily, having to empty it more often than not, poor quality compaired to the V6 animal, which did a good job lasting me over 6 years without a problem, plus you need to buy extra parts for the V7, as the V6 parts will not fit V7, does a quick vac, but forget dog fur, it gets stuck in the top of the stick all the time, would not buy again, will buy a different brand next time"
182,3,"Some design flawsWhen we bought this stick vacuum cleaner, we were told, it performs on hardfloor as well as on carpet. Unfortunately, this is not the case. We use this vacuum primarily for vacuuming litter around our litter boxes on a tile floor. You have to go over the same spot 2 or 3 times to get everything. Where it shines is on our pet futons, tablecloth and beds. It removes the pet fur very well. We don't have carpets on our floors, so I can't comment on that. But I suspect it does a good job on carpet as well. After vacuuming you have to be carefull, not to tilt the dust container to much to the front. Especially the solid, hard parts will fall back out of the cleaner. Lighter parts, like hair or fur will remain. The handle of the vacuum could be a bit more ergonomically designed. After cleaning for a few minutes, my hands start to hurt. Noiselevel from this vacuum is also quite high, without using even the turbo setting. The battery life, I think is sufficient. You don't use this vacuum as your main vacuum.
All in all, I think there are a few flaws in the design, but nothing which makes it unusable."
183,3,"Love the design but doesn't always 'suck'I have always been a fan of Dyson but after a few months of using the V7 cord free, the suction is slowly diminishing. ( Yes I clean the filters monthly) it is like the battery and suction system start to work less over time which is a shame. Positives are that it is completely cordless and doesn't take long to get to a full charge but I am now having to use it on the higher suction option which doesn't last anyway near long enough to clean my whole house."
184,3,Love itGreat little thing but battery life sucks doesn’t last long
185,3,"Handy vacuum for quick spillsGreat little cleaner.
The vacuum is great on hard services. We have wooden floors and tiles. The suction is very decent, but cannot suction going in reverse which isn't the best.
Battery charge is great, can do the house if needed, but need to empty the tub more often. This vacuum is great for quick spills and the kids love to use it - they will argue to use it which is great :)"
186,3,DISAPPOINTEDRecently I purchased the Dyson V7 stick vacuum cleaner. After fully charging it I cleaned my wooden floors and I am disappointed with the battery life as it lasted about 15 minutes.
187,3,"It's okay for a yearPurchased this bacuume In 2020. Second Dyson I've had and to be honest they just don't live up to the hype if you actually want clean carpet. Very neat assembly, not heavy, can manoeuvre. Neat little kit goes on the wall. However after 2 years the turbo will drain the battery in 5 seconds and after 3 years the battery life will halve, as will the suction power. The brushes on the foot wear down to nothing and you are forever untangling hair. I personally will never purchase another Dyson. I will invest in something that lasts longer."
188,3,"The main filter had issues after 3 monthsThe machine automatically stops. Dyson gave me a new filter. Literally, the main part of the machine can not work properly.
Hope the new one will last.

Suggest not buying this model if you can avoid it."
189,3,"Has it's faults for 1000 prototypesBought it a year ago, like others it has it's issues that drive me nuts.
First, there is 9 joins in the hose! after some wear and tear the joins become lose and ammit a high frequency sound, I've had to tape them up to shut it up. Second, the tab on the fill container broke. Third, the power switch has no grip so your finger and foot slides off without actually turning it on. Forth, when flicking out the brush for hard floors instead of sucking up dirt ect it just pushes it away. Way to many bristles.
Other than that its ok but i hate using it."
190,3,"Read on if you have an old DysonHad a DC39 Animal since 2012. Used my son's Cinetic Origin he bought last year to clean exact same areas. My thoughts are as follows:
Barrel design - pulling marginally improved, still a dog of a thing to pull - especially on pile carpet or when cord gets in the way and pull it over the cord. The tiny little wheel(s) front and back contribute little to the gliding over surfaces apart from smooth hardwood floors. Thankfully the change to the barrel has lowered the centre of gravity and it doesn’t fall on its side anywhere near as often as the DC39 when dragged.
Cannister - less fiddly to put back in after empting, people who use the DC39 will know it can be a hit and miss to get it right first up. The removed canister will now sit upright reliably if placed on the floor instead of falling over or rolling around on its side. Interesting design for emptying contents - definitely quicker to empty contents due to the drop down mechanism allowing waste to not jam against the side wall of the clear plastic as much. Still needs work, as the red push button on the cannister needs to be fully pushed down to return the clear plastic section back to original position, otherwise the ratchet engages early and shroud won't go back up. If you have pet hair, some will jam in the holes of the silver foil filter, and the ratchet/rail drop down mechanism prevents easy access - something the DC39 was better with access. So net benefit of the changes zero. Lots of flimsy components, so longevity may be an issue. Do not drop the cannister at all, there is only one small clip to lock the drop down lid in place - positioned just where it would hit the ground and snap off, rendering the canister useless and I presume a very expensive replacement. This clip needs some force to lock in properly. Something for Dyson to address.
Hose - Dyson have saved money here and used a less solid hose as it squashes a lot easier, so may split sooner with years of pulling (see above)
Wand - if you are a tall person you will consider updating, as you won't be stooping over as much. The caveat is that Dyson have again made some savings by using slightly thinner plastic – it doesn’t feel as solid. With the adapter you can use DC39 heads on your new Dyson (but not the other way around, naturally!). Not quite sold on the articulated section, did find a use when leaning over the back of couches etc, but longevity is likely to be an issue. The DC39 wand wears down the plastic at joins over time, causing air leaks when held in certain positions, so wouldn’t expect this wand to be any better. Feels solid new, but I can assure you the joins will get sloppier over the years. It’s the price you pay for not having heavier mild steel chrome wands. Periodically dismantle the wand and hose assembly if you have people in your family with long hair - it will resemble a shower drain plug with time, strings of gunge collect just as it does on the DC39.
Power head- My son bought the turbine head separately - take note dyson, it is cheaper to buy your base model and go to a service centre to buy the turbine head than to purchase a model where it comes with it! People are not stupid, adjust your prices appropriately. The service centres don’t even ask why you want to buy one anymore and keep heaps in stock. It is essentially the same deal as the DC39 though - still gets hair and cotton threads wound around the brush and a mongrel time consuming process to clean. Dyson, design something where the brush can be removed with minimal fuss! If you think to use a coin to turn the retainer disc on one end, don’t - it will wear loose over time to a point where the retainer disc falls out during use. This is a high speed rotating device and needs a solid housing.
Suction - the no loss of suction claim is nonsense. The DC39 experiences it, however the cinetic has a larger % drop off in suction as the waste canister fills up. Not sure if it has anything to do with the ""shaver"" foil filter on the canister. Massive difference in suction and turbine head rotation between full and empty compared to my 10 year old DC39. A quick dismantle of the DC39, a wash of the centre filter and a blow out with a compressor and you’re good to go as new. There is no washable filter with the cinetic, but probably means the motor filter inside the barrel that you can’t service as easily will clog more as I can tell you the amount of dust the washable filter collects is significant. Probably a deliberate ploy by dyson like car dealerships – service costs are more profitable over time.
Power cord: Dyson saved some money again, significantly shorter than the DC39.
Dual mode floor tool - certainly in hard floor mode removes things off of the floor a lot better than our DC39 hard floor tool (which gets clogged with pet hair and stops things being sucked up until the hair is removed) I think largely due to the purple plastic wiper blades, with the caveat that dyson need to change the location of where objects are sucked up on the dual mode tool. There are only holes at the side, nothing at the back, and tiny cutouts on the front blade, meaning that hair/larger objects are dragged backwards/forwards on hard floors until you lift the head to suck it up the wand. Side slots are great for up against architraves, but forward back motion it is not. It is a shame that the height adjustment is one way - drop down is automatic, but raising requires the user to lift the wand to access the head and manually push it back up, despite the two separate levers that do the same thing. This head is large, and so don't expect it to twist and rotate neatly parallel to the wand to access narrow spaces behind cupboards etc like the hard floor tool does. (NB Dyson, please weight the hard floor tool such that it doesn't lay on a 45 degree angle to the floor with the slightest friction when pulling the wand backwards or forwards).
On/off and power cord retract buttons - as long as you are using fingers or gentle bare feet (sheepskin slippers, you get the idea), these are a real danger of being snapped off by shoes and a bit of force. Not a bad idea, just not implemented well given the intended way it is to be used.
Overall - some gains, some losses. I don't think I will be throwing out the DC39 yet. People complain about the filter inside the barrel with the motor. Yep, wouldn't attempt unless you take your time, are a bit of a handy person and have tools (the torx screws can be undone by a smaller allen key). But the DC39 has same idea, and went 11 years to its first clean (and the filter was slightly damaged in the dyson factory!) and still running on the original, so may not need to get so fussy as suggested!"
191,3,"Check out my 5 year reviewExpensive but has excellent suction at first to the point had to reduce suction on floor tool to push on carpet. My thick Carpets come up really well. Comes with all the handy tools which are easy to change with clip system. The spin tool is great on car mats and the lounge. The hard floor tool glides around so easy but does not pick up small items like bread clips, so constantly picking things up and filling pockets. The floor tool also clogs up easy requires cleaning often. Disapointed with Wheels you have to tug it around even on tile floor. Sometimes tips over and bangs walls. Not making it fall over would be smarter then it picking itself up. Has no rubber bumpers. I tend to pick it up in areas with lots of obstacles to knock it over its not to heavy. Found suction reduces if bin is less then half full, however Quick and Easy to empty. The bin clip failed first year spilling waste everywhere and the wheel fell off while falling over. Customer service promptly picked up repaired and returned. The tube and tools are bulky for some reason and could be lighter. Also Bulky to store. I purchased a straw basket. The blind tool is great but the fan tool is a bit awkward to use weight and bulkness again not helping. 5 years on still going. Teenager pulled cord out to far and will no longer retract. Top of the canister cracked when falling over. Fixed with liquid nails. Suction reduced really bad and began to smell mouldy. Tried washing canister filter which is not recommended in manual. This helped suction slightly and heaps of dirt washed out. (Made sure it was completely dry before use). Built in paper exhaust filter was wet causing the musky smell and reducing suction. Thus manual saying not to run over water. Try telling teenagers that. Handle spring broke that you pull in to reduce suction about 3 years in. Easily Replaced ordering online at dyson only around $20.00 . Still the pick of the bunch due to strong suction motor but some innovation design tweeks needed."
192,3,"Great suction butThis vacuum would be AWESOME IF it had a turbo powered head attachment!!! This would enable the user to thoroughly clean their carpeted floors, rugs, mats with ease. A self cleaning filter would be ideal as well"
193,3,"Who on earth designed this?I bought my Dyson V12 because of my arthritis and the lightness. That works. And I can handle having to clean the bin after such a short time as I have a lot of carpet. However after only a year the vacuum pulsated constantly, even though I had cleaned it to within an inch of its life! The reason? Eventually found the area between where the barrel goes on and the filter comes off was full of very fine dust - not the clogged up dust bunny it shows being extracted out the side of the machine on the video. There is absolutely no way you can get into this area of the machine. I tried pushing up a cloth, a toothbrush, even a bottle brush. Eventually hubby took it up to the shed and blew it out with his air compressor. Hey presto!! But how many people have an air compressor handy?? This is a very bad design error on a machine that is supposed to clean, and then be cleaned.
I have also resorted to buying another filter so I can exchange them and finish my job instead of having to wait 24 hours for the filter to dry.
I like the product for its ease of use with my arthritis - but surely for something that costs over $1,000 someone in the engineering-design dept can take one home and use it for a year in dusty conditions, then amend the design so that it can be cleaned so at least it works. It very nearly got chucked in the bin."
194,3,"Does the job, but wouldn't raveBuild quality is my main gripe. For the price, I would have expected much better. Cheap $200 vacuums have better quality plastic than this Dyson. Very disappointing. If I could have returned based on this, I would have. Its baffling why light-weight but durable plastic was not used?!
Barrel NOT easy to empty as the marketing suggests; you have to pull out the debris manually, it DOES NOT drop out automatically because it essentially wraps around the cylindrical barrel, especially hair, longer fibres etc.
Barrel size is fine for my apartment, but would be too small for three bedroom home or larger."
195,3,"Not satisfiedOur family were big fans of Dyson. But this one really let us down. The major problem is it doesn't pick up everything (I have changed several heads, and it's too inefficient to rely on the smallest head to pick up the small dirt). I feel the suction power is too weak."
196,3,"Was hoping for more but it does serve a purposeHaving the V11 outsize, which has become our 'daily driver', this was definitely a different experience. In comparison, I love how light this unit is, and also feels well balanced in the hand... but suction wise it's really incomparable - as you'd expect to be honest based on it's size & weight.
In brief, this vac is light & has a nice form factor, the swivelability of the powerhead is great and feels nice to use, is good on a hard floor for small particles, dust, dirt & hair, not great on carpet (takes a big longer, still does the job though), also good for the car & couch with the attachments.

I wouldn't be getting this vac to use as a primary vac personally, but to quickly pull out and suck up the daily dust, hair and the odd bit of dirt, this unit does that and does it nicely, relatively quickly and comfortably.

The design is rather different, and the intake hole at in the center of the two powerheads is quite small, so gets blocked easily with anything not small. I think if you get this unit you'd likely have a small unit with primarily hard floods (tiles, floating floor, timber, lino etc). We've not had it go flat on us for how we use it, and always put it on it's most powerful suction mode - it would be nice if this mode was an option via a toggle switch (or saved from previous use) and we didn't have to press the button on the machine to put it in boost mode every time we use it.

As with all the Dyson units, in my opinion, this is easy to empty and clean the filters, swapping the attachments is 'as usual' and very straightforward. The only negative I can this of was the material on one of the powerheads did come off the powerhead slightly in one spot, easy enough to fix with a bit of glue though, shouldn't happen on a machine this price - and likely would be replaced under warranty with no hassle if it did happen to you.

Pro's:
- Good battery life for how we use it
- Nice weight & balance, and swivel powerhead feels great and is nice to use
- Easy emptying
- Good for a quick vac of small particles on hard floors
- Can do carpet if you need it to, don't expect the world!
- Good set of included attachments, good for car & couch

Con's:
- Small suction inlet
- Not our choice for carpet use but can do it
- Boost suction button needs to be pressed every time the machine is used
- Material on powerhead seems to be able to come off easily, likely an easy warranty claim"
197,3,"Get a Dyson…just maybe not this oneOur entire home is hard wood floors and small marble tile, so in theory the small Omni-glide should fit the part for our requirements. The reality was it had very limited application, and served simply as a broom substitute or a ‘dust-buster’ style appliance to quickly spot clean. I don’t really feel that you are getting amazing value for money here, especially considering how diverse in use and generally enjoyable many other Dyson vacuums are.
The Omni-glide does as it states - it glides beautifully across hard floors. Unfortunately we also have rugs, so that created a complete dead end for the ‘fluffy brush’ head. The small ‘spot cleaning’ head just wasn’t adequate to efficiently and effectively clean our large rugs.

The lighter weight and button switch should theoretically create more comfortable and user friendly experience. However, the ergonomics of holding the width of the handle places a disproportionate amount of pressure on your ring and pinky fingers as well as the lateral aspect of your wrist. I found this extremely uncomfortable within just a few minutes of use and found myself wishing for the older style ‘pistol grip’ style of handle. The ergonomics of the handle was much more comfortable when used hand held for cleaning up high such as tops of windows and cornicing.

If you have kids or pets, you will likely be stopping to empty the small canister every few minutes. The head of the vacuum also seems to get hair and string stuck within it next to the rollers, and after each use I found myself having to pick this out which quite honestly was driving me crazy. We have a relatively small home,so the battery life was sufficient for us- however larger homes may struggle with battery life unless additional batteries are purchased.

Depending on what you need and the size of your home, this may be the vacuum for you. But considering the price and the restrictive nature of the design and its application, you may prefer to consider other options within the Dyson range."
198,3,"Dyson Omni - Glide it does... but what else?Out of the box, the Dyson Omni-glide looks like something Gru from Despicable Me shrunk to 1/10th of the original size. If you've owned one of the other Dyson V Series stick vacuums, then you'll know what I'm talking about (see my review on the Dyson V11). I'll quickly say to those reading this review that if you're after a vacuum to clean LARGE hard-floor areas, this vacuum is not for you.
The Omni-glide is effectively an electronic broom that you pull out of your closet for spot-cleaning on timber or tiled floors or run over the couch after your kids have had a movie night with friends. Why? The head and dust-bin are too small, and the battery life doesn't take too long to run flat, especially if you run it in boost mode.
If you're still reading this review, let me break this down further and provide you with the Pros and Cons of this vacuum after 1 month of use.
PROS:
- The brush head on this vacuum makes cleaning up effortless on hard, delicate surfaces. The small multidirectional wheels allow you to glide in and out of chairs with practically no labour to a point where I'd never pick up a broom again. It is so portable.
- Compared to the larger Dyson V Series, the Omi-Glide would favour someone who struggles with a vacuum's weight or difficulties using a broom. The other benefit of this vacuums reduced weight is that it allows you to hold it up high for windows, vents, and additional delicate cleanings with limitless effort.
- The compact size of the barrel and battery allow this vacuum to be used for cleaning the car. Its reduced size makes it practical to reach into foot-well areas, although access between the seats and console is limited.
- The ultimate use I found for this vacuum was to reach under our furniture. My couch is raised off the ground and has become a dust haven. The delicate brush head guard prevented cords from being wound around the rollers.
- The re-charge dock is easy to mount and provides a location that will force you to return the vacuum every time.

CONS:
- The issue I found with the Omni-Glide head is debris got trapped between the brush and plastic roller flap (see photo). I had better success in cleaning larger debris with it in boost mode, but that comes at a price with reduced battery time.
- There is no run-time battery indicator. Much like its bigger brother, it would be great to have some form of indication of the remaining power.
- Not sure if it's just me, but I found myself constantly turning off the vacuum due to the location of the power button.
- Dyson provides a range of attachments, which I found to be using the soft brush of the combi tool most of the time. Much of the suction is lost unless you press the soft brush closer to the surface.
- It would be great to include a flexible hose that you could connect the attachments to.
- In addition, Dyson needs to provide a right angle flexible head that allows access to the top of your window pelmets. It would significantly extend the usefulness of this lightweight vacuum.
Summary;
3.5 Stars. Would I recommend buying it? Dyson have engineered a great product yet again but it's not brilliant. I would assume the next generation will be better. However, it is not a cheap vacuum just for cleaning small areas around the house and is something you need to consider. For example, I have over 100m2 of hard floors downstairs alone, making this unsuitable. However, I find myself reaching for the Omni-glide over the broom because of its manoeuvrable head, allowing me to get around chairs in the kitchen."
199,3,"A Good Product But With Limited ApplicationAt first glance, the Dyson Omni-glide appears to be the smaller sibling of the V10 Outsize. It comes with a similar array of easy to fit, albeit smaller attachments, such as two power heads, one of which is a dual roller head, a clever wand with a brush attachment that can be slid backwards and forwards, depending on whether or not you want to use it, and other attachments for hard to get at places. There is a removable battery, and it also has a wall mount and a charger. Anyone who has used any of Dyson's vacuum cleaners will be able to find their way around this device in no time, and anyone new to the brand will soon learn that one thing clicks into another and they only do it one way. One thing that does set it apart from other cleaners, is that it is a single, wand shape. That is, it is basically a long, series of cylinders of varying diameters. Unlike the Outsize V10, the Omni-glide is a light weight, which is a huge plus. This makes it an easy-to-use tool for getting rid of dust on top of door frames, or even spider webs on cornices. It is also a small diameter of only about eight centimetres at its motor.
The motor unit, (or whatever it’s called), can easily be plugged in and charged. Everything comes apart for cleaning, including the dust collector which can be completely removed. There are two buttons on the handle, one for “eco” mode, and one for full power. Battery condition is indicated by a single LED.
Initially, I used the Omni-glide for carpeted stairs that were covered in fine cat fur. I attached the two-roller head which stopped almost immediately, so I attached the single roller cleaning head which seemed to be the right tool for the job. I found that the Dyson struggled when using the ""eco"" setting, so I used the “max” setting which got the job done. Next, I cleaned the polished floor under my bed base. I usually clean under it with a traditional vacuum cleaner with the cleaning wand folded flat which leaves it on a weird angle and difficult to use. Thanks to the small diameter of the Omni-glide, I was able to clean under the bed easily and effectively. To sum up, the two-roller head, whilst useless on carpet, did a good job of hard floors. Its design lets it swivel around between chair legs and the like in such a way that there’s not much it can’t get to. The single roller head did a reasonable job on carpet and our fabric lounge and dining chairs which also get covered in cat fur. Both do a much more convincing job on the “max” setting but there is one major draw back to using the Omni-glide and that’s battery life…
When used solely on the eco setting, I can get about twenty minutes of use. The max setting seems to be only for emergencies. So while “max” dramatically increases power, battery life is reduced proportionally. Other down sides are the small dust receptacle, which needs frequent emptying, at least in my house which has two cats and two teenagers in it. I also found that when emptying, I had to completely remove the receptacle, not just flip it open over the bin as with Outsize V10. The other beef I have, and I have it with the Outsize too, is that the rollers need to be cleaned after every use. I get that they are very effective at getting dust off a surface and into the wand, but with two, long haired women in the house, I find that after every use, they must be dismantled and cleaned.
So why buy a vacuum that doesn’t run for long and needs to be emptied frequently? Well, in my opinion, this isn’t the cleaner you should choose for a full-size family home. What it would be great for, is a granny flat, studio apartment, a small business, or anywhere where space is at a premium. Somewhere where you may not have the room to move furniture, or where doing so would be inconvenient."
200,3,"Great design but limited purpose, would ideally give 3.5 starsThe omni-glide has a great look, and (personal opinion) is the most attractive and streamlined design of all their vacuums. Operationally, one of the biggest positive changes of the omni from the v series is the rotating head, which makes it extremely easy to manoeuvre, especially if you have a small house with a lot of corners that you need to navigate around (honestly, I cannot rave enough about the rotation). It's so easy to use and manoeuvrable that the other connecting parts were rarely needed. Another positive is that it's so lightweight and shorter (when all pieced together) that it prevents your arm getting tired from either the weight or the leverage (unlike the v 10/11). It also has an actual ""on/off"" button as opposed to the ""trigger"" which is a personal preference in terms of whether it makes it easier to use (yes your hand won't cramp up but you would also waste more battery power unless you're constantly turning it off during use). The downside is that the rotating head that's included is for hard floors only. So if you have carpet/rugs, you're going to need another vacuum. And being smaller and more lightweight, it also has less suction power. It managed to work for dust and small debris, but struggled with slightly larger scraps of paper, as well as dried modelling clay, which sometimes became congested between the brush bars (however this was easy to remove by simply sliding the brush bars out). I also noticed that upon disassembling, some small debris would drop out from the vicinity of canister (possibly because the suction was not strong enough to fully pull the rubbish in before turning it off). When it did manage to suction up slightly larger debris (i.e. scrap of tissue), it became congested in the ""inlet"" to the canister, because the inlet is so small. Although this may seem like a long list of negatives, this vacuum is fantastic, but only for a specific type of home. It would be great for those who have hard floors and ESPECIALLY with rooms that are cramped with furniture, that would normally have to be moved during cleaning with other vacuums. However it has limited purpose in homes that require extensive cleaning, and if you need to vacuum up more than your average dust particles or small debris (i.e. if you have young children who really know how to make a mess) this is not the vacuum for you. As with all Dyson cordless vacuums, the Achilles heel is their battery life. Depending on the size of your house, it may need multiple charges for a full clean. On the ""max"" setting I managed to clean two rooms before the battery ran out of power.
At the end of the day, Dyson needs to include the rotating head as part of the arsenal for their next v series vacuum. Higher suction power and the rotation combined would be amazing."
201,3,"Not so superiorOkay I’ve owned a lot of various Dyson vacuums and at first I thought that this Dyson took the cake of awesomeness until I realised that the dirt on the floor had been flicking back out behind me even when using the ~ and + function on the head. The head motor is annoying when you need to pull off the tube and head to use the tool for those little spots I find that the suction is low and the head doesn’t come back on automatically and requires you to switch off and on the appliance and or when the head gets caught.
My v8 animal works a lot better in comparison but it’s just not as compact as what I would have liked. I find that the animal stick had a better battery run time also. So unfortunately I do not rate this product best of 2023 and wish I had of purchased an alternative product"
202,3,"Below expectationsWorks ok on my hardwood floors and cleans well but takes longer than sweeping due to the narrow fluffy optic head. I have a fairly small house but ran out of battery on full charge trying to pick up all the dust the laser revealed. The nifty laser has a narrow focus so can’t see dust immediately to the right, around or behind the head. If you remove the head to use the inbuilt vacuum head and reattach the fluffy optic head, the laser doesn’t come on until you switch the machine off and on again every time. The on/off switch is in a terrible place and requires two hands. When you need to switch it off quickly you suddenly realise how badly placed it is. I am fairly fit and lift weights regularly but this gets heavy to use before long and doesn’t stand up on its own. The small dustbin can only be filled half way so I need to empty pet hair frequently or it clogs the filter. To empty you need to detach the tube first which falls over easily. The wall mount stand that comes with it has two slots but due to the narrow spacing is impossible to fit more than one accessory! No way to search for accessories that fit this particular model.
For the price, I expected better.
Note that buying directly from Dyson you get a few hundred dollars worth of included accessories. Learned the hard way that they are not included when purchased from a retailer and are out of stock. After market stand endorsed by Dyson representative in store does not fit the plug or wire and the screws are too short."
203,3,"Some major flawsReplacement for a faulty V11 absolute :
Just unpacked it today :
Pros :
-The fluffy head roller is really nice to use, flows well on floorboards and lino, the light shows so much fluff up (used in low light) and seems to pick up a huge amount.
The V11 fluffy roller was awkward to use but this one is great.
I was really skeptical about the efficiency of the light but boy does it show up the mess, I was shocked with how filthy my hard floors actually were.
-A little quieter, especially with the fluffy roller head attached.
-The power button : no more sore finger holding a trigger. I thought I would struggle without the trigger as I'm so used to it but the ""on/off"" button is fine. Could they have placed it in a better position..... Absolutely.
It would be nice to be able to access the button without having to use 2 hands.

Cons :
-Way overpriced.
-Heavier than the V11 by nearly 500g.
-The display is a bit gimmicky, and it doesn't seem to clear itself with each use.
-The docking station is just awful, V11 had a much more user friendly dock.
It's quite stiff, vacuum doesn't slide in and out easily and it's so hard to remove the front plate if needed.
-Battery life seems worse as the machine is constantly changing suction levels with both the heads.
-Dyson have slightly changed the connection for any motorized tools so you can't use any motorized accessories from previous models (just another way of forcing customers to purchase more).
They also changed the filter so previous model filters are useless. And for the price, you would expect a spare filter considering that the filter can't be used for 24 hours after washing it.
-But the biggest design flaw is with the digital motorbar. Because the suction is stronger, the motorbar struggles to spin on the carpet.
I always used my V11 on auto with the gate in the middle setting. I could go from hardwood floors to carpet, the suction would increase once with no issues.
The Gen5 motorbar just stops spinning on the auto setting, you have to move the gate to minus or go to eco mode. What's the point of stronger suction if its impossible to use!
I have 2 grades of twist plush pile carpet, the motorbar seems to be ok with the highest grade carpet (more dense) but is terrible on the standard twist plush pile.
I watched reviews about this very issue before getting the machine but thought people were just being a little critical..... I was so wrong, it's a huge design flaw and Dyson really need to address it. The motorbar needs to be re designed to suit the suction level.
When you try these machines in the stores, all the carpet is ultra low pile office carpet so the motorbar works fine, it's on normal carpet found in most homes that it completely fails.
If you have mainly carpeted areas, this probably isn't the machine for you.

Overall, I wish I had chosen to have my V11 repaired, it was so much more user friendly and catered for all my flooring.
Dyson...... With what you charge for your products, you actually need to listen to your customers and fix the flaws."
204,3,"Vacuum head not fit-for-purposeI purchased the V11 stick vacuum in November 2019. I previously had a regular Dyson vacuum. Within 2 years the motor malfunctioned and had to be repaired. After 4 years the soft roller cleaner head became unusable as the ridiculously thin bits of felt-like material had worn down and so my wooden floors were not protected. I live alone in a small 2 x1 unit and vacuum once a week. This is utterly ludicrous - vacuum heads normally outlast the vacuum and should last way more than a few years. I don't know if the newer models have the same head for delicate floors but if so they are basically not fit-for-purpose. The head would barely last a year for someone living in a 3x2 or larger house. The replacement heads are not in stock and despite leaving a notification request, two months later there are still none available from Dyson. There is no way to contact Dyson if you are not on social media so your only option is to call and be put through to someone in southeast Asia who has no idea when they will come in, if ever. Just last week I ordered parts for my German rangehood that is 18 years old and they were delivered via courier in 24 hours. Less than 5 years after buying the Dyson stick, I have no idea if I will be able to replace the main head that I use. If you are considering buying a Dyson stick vacuum, I would strongly recommend you consider other brands. In my entire life I have never had a vacuum where I had to get a replacement head. I know have serious concerns re the quality and durability of Dyson products, despite having several. So much for cutting-edge technology and sustainability."
205,3,"Great Vacuum, Not So Great For Around EdgesBought the dyson v11 thinking we are updating our old v6. It is a great vacuum for open areas, however when it comes to around the skirting and furniture.. Doesn't really have the suction to get the edges. This is the only issue. Battery lasts easily for full standard house vacuum."
206,3,Initially great but was a let downAs I stated was initially great but after 3 weeks the head of the lux would not spin snd there was a strong burning smell returned to shop and they sent back to Dyson who replaced a part returned to me within a week. Unfortunately within 2 weeks the same thing happened again so back to Dyson who replaced the whole head of the lux so was returned to me after 3 weeks so fingers crossed I'm 3rd time lucky.
207,3,Its an okay vaccummIt works okay not to easy to move around suction is good.
208,3,"An ""ok"" vacuum, not what I expected from dysonI was stoked to purchase my first dyson whilst on special at big w, but this was very short lived.
The most annoying feature on this unit is the ""hight reach"" hose wand. This is a complete design fail. It doesn't reach very far at all and I find myself having to hold the whole unit whilst using the wand as to keep it from toppling over. It's hopeless trying to go over skirting boards etc. Overall this part of the vacuum is not user friendly.
Now to the main part, the head of the vacuum. It does a well enough job on hard surfaces. Has a strong suction for this but, when using on carpet or our rug it seems to struggle a bit and doesn't perform as you'd expect.
Keep in mind I regularly clean the whole unit and look after it. Even on special, it was a big purchase for my budget but I'd always wanted a shiny new dyson.

After using this vacuum it definately deters me from ever purchasing another dyson. I expected alot more. Disappointing!"
209,3,"Disappointing Purchase From a Trusted BrandI bought this as an upgrade from my handheld which I love but just not powerful enough for a household with 3 dogs. We have hard wood floors and carpet.
What I love:
Powerful enough to pick up dog hair from the carpet, performed above my expectations in this area.
No head changes to go from hard surfaces to carpet.
Light weight and easy to manoeuvre when being used as an upright.
Connected to power and not reliant on battery time.
Generally well made and sturdy.

What I don't like:
The cord, gets in the way, I wonder if a retractable cord would be a better option but his is a minor annoyance and something I was prepared for when purchasing.
The bin is a little small.
The upright version is not small enough to get under the average bed or couch - you will need the stick and that can is reviewed in the next paragraph.

What I hate:
The stick for high reach places/under furniture/vacuuming couches/cars etc. It's absolutely useless. The tubing is so cumbersome it bounces right back to the retracted position but not before knocking the unit down to the floor and breaking one of my pot plants. You need at least one hand to hold the tubing and the other for the vacuuming but then there is nothing left but your feet to move a or hold a cushion to vacuum. Maybe easier with two people but in my experience, those who clean together do not stay together and vacuuming should really be a one person job. So I'm now needing to continue to use my ageing stick vacuum and looking at having to replace it and overall, this current purchase is going to cost me more money than I wanted or should have to spend.

Summary:
If you're after primarily an upright for larger areas (keeping in mind it doesn't get right into corners or edges, although this particular unit is powerful enough to pick up some of this) then you won't be disappointed. However if you are like me and was super excited about the power of an upright with the versatility to use the stick for the smaller things then this is a very disappointing design from a brand that prides itself on research and development on making their products user friendly. I have no idea how this made it out of the drawing room. I would recommend looking at other brands. I wish I hadn't assumed that the Dyson brand wouldn't lead me astray. I'm just glad I don't have stairs!"
210,3,"Sucks really well with the right carpet, butWooden floors, tiles, persian rugs and most carpets - does a great job
One dense carpet - power head stalls every 5 seconds, and the cleaner needs to be turned off and on again to get another 5 seconds. After 6 months the power head motor seized and had to be replaced, but the problem remains."
211,3,"Has it’s downfallsSuction wise, it’s perfectly fine. Perhaps a little under powered but nothing worth fretting over.
We use it for our 4 bedroom house with a mix of carpet and tiles. I find that things like loose cat kibbles get pushed around, thus anything that size gets pushed rather than sucked into the machine. That can be quite irritating.
The machine is very plastic feeling. When manoeuvring I can feel the top handle warp, I’m not concerned it will break but it certainly isn’t sturdy.

The hose can be used but I find it very awkward to use, always feels like you’re breaking the hose. A weird design choice from Dyson that’s for sure.

The motor burnt out after 6 months, I’m not sure if that could be compounded by the fact I use it for 40 minutes at a time twice a week, or if the motor was genuinely faulty. I hope the latter but time will tell how durable it is.

Saying that, the service process was speedy and effective and when they sent the machine back it had been cleaned like new. A nice touch."
212,3,Good for Small JobsI purchased the V7 Trigger model in 2018 from Bing Lee as I was looking for a handheld vacuum cleaner for small jobs around the house. It has strong suction for a handheld. Battery does not last very long if you hold down the power button for a long period of time. The trick to getting the most out of the battery is only press the button when you need to. The size of the dust bin could be larger though.
213,3,"Electrolux ErgorapidoHi I recieved this vacumme recently and i really like everything about it.. it is a wonderful, solidly built 100% reliable machine that has good suction and reasonable battery life.. that is so convenient and a pleasure to use.. but it has a fatal flaw.. the battery is not replacable.. the whole hand unit needs to be replaced.. which basically means it is a throw away landfill item.. which saddens me greatly and puts me off buying another.."
214,3,"It’s good but will look for anotherI bought this stick vacuum a few years ago, for around $220 from the Good Guys on Marion Road. This has the allergy filter on it, and I will say, this filter is very good - so much dust and general grossness accumulates on the outside of it, but when I go to replace or clean the allergy filter, the inside is completely pristine, ergo (zing!) I believe the filter works very well. In terms of the function of this stick vacuum, it works well - hard floors are a breeze, it'll pick up everything, and even does a great job cleaning carpets. It can't replace a proper corded vacuum cleaner, but for general and daily cleaning, it performs very well. The only thing it doesn't suck up is sticky things off the floors, like stickers and tape (I have a 1 year old and a 4 year old, hence the stickers and tape!). My home is a one bedroom apartment, with tiled kitchen, bathroom and laundry, and a carpeted hallway, bedroom and very large living room.
However, there are some issues. The first one is the actual design and manufacturing. It is not well made. From the onset, bits started falling off. The clip on the base broke and I had to tape it to keep it on - I had to keep it on, because it keeps the rolling brush in place. Also, the other clip which keeps a metal square part, also keeping the roller brush in place, broke shortly after. The lights on the base which help to illuminate dark corners stopped working within about 6 months. Finally, in March 2020, the vacuum hose which attaches the base of the stick vacuum to the dust buster section disengaged, and now I can't use it at all as a stick vacuum. Upon closer inspection, one screw keeps the entire base of the machine in place, and takes the brunt of all the swivelling of the base. Basically, the inner workings of the machine are great, but the manufacturing and design are not. The good news is that because it is manufactured locally, I could probably get it fixed, however it is out of warranty. I have a sneaking suspicion that even if it got fixed, it would break again - it's just not that well made."
215,3,Great but doesn't lastGreat on floorboard and tiles. You do need to be quite quick as the battery doesn't last long. Over time it's battery times gets even shorter. Love that is cuts hair and has a light. Easy to use eve my kids use it. Have already replaced it after a year due to the battery
216,3,"Overall happy with a better cleaner, but isn't all rosyI replaced a Dyson upright with this unit. The circuit board failed after a few weeks and was replaced under warranty.
Compared with Dyson:

Positives: longer reach (cord+hose) so less power point changes; cleans deep pile carpet much better; places now get cleaned that rarely saw a vacuum (eg under beds, couches, behind lamps in corners etc); exhaust is further away from the point of suction so less likely to result in dust/hair balls wafting into the air before you get to suck them up.

Negatives: hard to back-out of a dead-end; have to be careful you don't tread on the hose; have to swap heads between hard floor & carpet; cord is thinner and tends to get jammed under things where a fat, round cord didn't; if you get beside the unit, the hot exhaust on your legs isn't nice in summer; the mechanism to stand the handle upright when you need to hands to move something is fiddly to engage, and has worn-out on the carpet head.

Overall, I'm happy that it cleans better and I end-up cleaning awkward places more frequently than I used to."
217,3,"Cleans great, fails too earlyPurchased 4 years ago to cope with large dog's hair shedding. Vacuumed well, but the rotary brush head was noisy. Two year later the rotary head died. Purchased new rotary head which even sounded different and lasted well. After a total of 4 years ownership, the motor burned out and died.
Recently purchased a new one, same model (hoping it will last longer). Rotary brush head again rattling and pivot is sticking - fortunately having kept the old replacement head I am using it instead.
We use it once a week and daily use an Eletrolux stick vac Ergorapido, which was also purchased 4 years ago and still going strong.
Love how well the C9 cleans and its accessories, not impressed with the durability. When this one fails, I will replace it with a more expensive German brand."
218,3,"No way!!!!Got my vacuum delivered yesterday. Looks good.. in under 10 minutes, the turbo brush broke inside with a rattling noise!!!!
Bollocks Electrolux.. the normal multi floor brush head is good.. just bloody disappointed that the turbo head came apart almost straight away..!!!"
219,3,Economical vacuum cleaner with minimal quality accessoriesThis Electrolux vacuum cleaner was ideal for our budget as a spare machine at home. The 3-1 in-one-tool I found wasn't as effective as individual tools. Poorly designed 3-1 accessory and difficult to use. Compatible replacement bags are hard to find at local suppliers. Had to buy from Electrolux website. The tube to vacuum is very thin plastic and can kink when changing directions. The rear roller wheels are small so they won't roll easily over power cord. Hence you have to bend down and lift vacuum off cord when changing direction. Overall good suction. The retractable power cord mechanism could be more powerful preferably. Good length of power cord.
220,3,"Not the worst. But still not greatWhilst I don’t have animals - and thank god I don’t this vac struggles at the best of times.
If constantly cleaning the filters isn’t your thing this is not right for you. I find if I don’t go through and empty the filters every time, it just won’t suck.

All fittings seem to easily break too."
221,3,"Good compared to the cheap onesThe wife bought this a few months ago... It is a quick clean vacuum for during the week. I would not recommend this to a friend. It shuts off after 15 minutes of work... I went to Electrolux to buy a replacement filter... $79... So, I did an Internet search and I found it for $20 on Amazon..."
222,3,short cordgood vacuum for value but big drawback is the short electrical cord - means always using an extension cord or changing electrical outlets
223,3,"Disappointing productOur previous vacuum was an ELECTROLUX ZUA3820P which we'd had for 9 years and still went well, but we figured it was time for an update. We stuck with Electrolux after that good experience. Boy! Are we disappointed. It's 400 watts less power, but we knew that when we bought, and it was the front-runner of what was on offer. Once out of the box it was obviously inferior. The previous one (and still some of Electrolux vacs) was made in Hungary. This one was made in China, and it's obvious. Everything is of inferior quality from the floor part to the cord. The ""head"" is smaller hence requires more passes and is harder to switch between carpet and tiles. The tube is lightweight metal, has the extension section upside-down and is shorter so I have to bend a bit. The curve of the handle is such that it stresses the wrist as you manoeuvre it. The dust collector doesn't drop the ""dust ball"" when you open it and you have to dig it out. There is a band of dust that is permanently trapped at the top of the transparent bowl. The cord is at least 2 metres shorter than its predecessor which means I either run an extension or move from one powerpoint to another. It has a fairly high pitched whine. I can't say I'm even in love with the bright red colour but could easily forgive that if some of the other aspects were better. Verdict- it sucks!"
224,3,Nothing Ease-y about vacuuming with thisthe head has hard sharp edged plastic rim making it difficult to push the vacuum forward. It grabs the carpet and you have to shove it to move forward Medium-setting.
225,3,Improved with use - read your manualI earlier gave it a bad review for tiles/carpet because of small dust collection and poor sucking but found a filter that needs regular washing so it is better now.
226,3,"Fantastic suction and great valueAfter reading a lot of positive Reviews, I brought this corded stick cleaner as a temporary tool while my Dyson undergo repairs. Great on vinyl and wooden floor BUT not so good on rugs. I vacuum daily, have been using it for past 4 days, very happy with the performance, the filter managed to collect almost 70% of the dust if one needs to compare this stick cleaner to the Dyson upright cleaner. The Bissell has 2 years limited Warranty - it will be a matter to see if it would lasted that long because the motor gets very hot after 20 minutes that requires another 30 minutes to cool down.
28th Jan 2020 update: I reduced the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars today. Overall: Good machine BUT after 5 days usage on polished floor in a 2 bedroom unit, the footplate-blue-plastic tubing split. Bissell was efficient replaced the footplate BUT after serious consideration, I returned the cleaner to Harvey Norman for a full refund. Reason: I cannot be sure the durability of the machine. Though it has great suction."
227,3,"DON'T BOTHERFor the price this is very average. If something is slightly stuck it won't clean. The customer service is shocking. After 4 calls and 2hrs on the phone, no joy. They tell you they will call back but they don't. Very dissapointed."
228,3,"Parts are flimsy* UPDATE
Bissell will not send me a free foot even though the two I've purchased both broke in the same place. I won't be buying another Bissell product. Very poor customer service

I love the machine and it works pretty well. I do find if you don't clean the underside whilst you are cleaning, there are streaks. But that's been on a pretty dirty floor. I've replaced the foot window assembly twice already. (Had the machine about 3 years, the part is $30-50!) I've asked Bissell for a replacement foot free of charge. But I won't hold my breath"
229,3,"It's okI've always owned the Shark brand of vacuum.
When I moved to australia we purchased this Bissell brand as the sales people said it was one of the best and would workout cheaper if we needed parts etc.
First thought, it's alot more plastic than the Shark and doesn't feel as ""fancy"".
Controlling it is difficult, very bulky and difficult to manoeuver at times.
The base and hose don't disattach from it either like the shark so vacuuming the car is difficult.

Had to return our first one within 3 months as the turbo head stopped working, without the turbo head suction is useless.
Got a complete replacement from Godfreys, then 1 month later the replacement one wasn't sucking and had a burning smell to it.
Turns out the hose was blocked at the bottom with a piece of paper I had vacummed up and the burning smell was in the turbo head foot as two pieces of rubber were rubbing together.
I rang Godfreys for a refund as I'm over it, and would prefer a Shark again but they said I was past the store warrantry period for refunds.
But then the smell sorted itself out and stopped.

Took it all apart to clean it again a few weeks ago as burning smell came back and have noticed that in the turbo foot the plastic as worn/melted on the sides of the brushes (where it spins).

Due to the covid I haven't followed this up further."
230,3,"Really poor on wooden floor to but see editI bought this because I have wood floors and it claims to be ""Great"" on hard floors. It isn't. Really poor suction, which is odd when you see how many watts it pulls. It might pick up dust but anything larger and it just acts like a bad broom.
Edit - so I discovered that the hose was blocked. Clearing that improved the suction. It now works, although I still wouldn't call it an impressive vacuum cleaner."
231,3,"Low cost, but with limitationsWe needed a vacuum cleaner quickly and this model was available at a 'special' price. Would we buy it again if we had more time to assess various models? .. No.
Pros..
Relatively (to other vacuum cleaners) low cost.
Small and lightweight
Various attachments and vacuum heads.
Reasonable suction, provided that the filters are kept clean i.e. cleaned after every use.

Cons..
Cheap build quality. Feels as if something could break quite readily.
Hose diameter is small, and the handle does not sit well in the hand (small hands may be better!)
Small dust capture bin i.e. it has to be cleaned out very regularly.
Loses suction if the filters (especially the zig-zag paper (hepa?) filter and associated foam rubber) are not cleaned often.
On our carpet the vacuum head did not slide properly over the pile. It tended to jump. This could be because of the shortness of the metal pipe and thus the angle of the vacuum head.
Short cord.

This vacuum cleaner is more suited to a small apartment rather than a house. We'll buy something of better quality in the future."
232,3,"Not great but does the jobThe Bissell vacuum and mop combo offers convenience but falls short in some aspects. While its dual functionality is handy, the cleaning results can be hit or miss, often leaving streaks behind. Achieving a thorough clean might require multiple passes, which can be time-consuming.
Additionally, the battery life might not meet expectations, requiring frequent recharges during larger cleaning sessions. Despite its versatility, the need for multiple passes and occasional streaking can be drawbacks for those seeking more efficient cleaning solutions."
233,3,Perfect except for the battery failureHave a Bosch ZOO'O 25.2V Lithium Power Pro-Animal Brush vacuum cleaner. It has been brilliant but then suddenly the battery is only lasting about 5 minutes on high speed which is the speed needed for the picking up of dog hair. Can the battery be replaced or is this for the dump now? Such a shame to throw it away and all the extras we have to go with it.
234,3,"Non-serviceable battery in a $600 vacuum?Writing this on behalf of my mother in law who was widowed a year ago and does not do technology well.
The vacuum has worked well for 5 years but now it doesn't hold charge. Even after several hours charging it stops running after just a few minutes. Have read other reviews and it is very disappointing the battery is non-serviceable.
More disappointing is just 2 year warranty - this seems cynical knowing a battery has a finite life and it's terrible design to then make it non-replaceable."
235,3,Bosch have problemsThe vacuum has some minor issues which personal attention can rectify. What is of major issue is the inability of the Company to honour what was offered on the purchase of this product. The Company has been contacted by me on many occasions regarding this issue with no resolution. It may be that the company is experiencing some serious problems.
236,3,"Great vacuum when it worksLove the power of this vacuum but it seems to be one issue after the other. First the handle snapped and I purchased a new one for $100. Not a week later the turbo will only last 2-3 seconds before the vacuum switches off completely! Now the floor brush has stopped spinning! As mentioned, great vacuum when it works, perhaps I have a dud!"
237,3,Battery dies after ten minutesMy Bosch Athlet is around three years old. For the past year and a half the battery only lasts around 10 minutes.. I called Bosch about six months ago and they didn’t bother calling back. So disappointing. Can I get the batteries replaced?
238,3,A few issuesResearched this Vac and little disappointed. Emptying the dust container is messy. The main issue though is the filters... the red light comes on sometimes only 10 mins after starting and I find that I have to wash completely each part of the filter (not just shake off the dust) every time I use it but I have to say that Bosch customer service has been very good and sorted the problem promptly.
239,3,"Mediocre at bestThe lg cord zero is an absolute waste of money,sure it works, but mediocre at best. Suction is mediocre, they break fairly easily just like any other stick vac and getting parts is a hassle, be prepared to wait weeks. Emptying one out is the equivalent of going outside and taking a roll in the dirt ,you are gonna need to take a shower after because you are going to be covered in crud by the time you get it clean. Honesty it does nothing better and some things worse than say a $200 bosch r'ready stick vac .I have had both and I know which one I would buy again .I could buy 3 of the Bosch For the price of one lg ,and the bosch is just simply a better machine."
240,3,"No good with hairGreat at first but after a while the the under padding wares off so its hard plastic scraping your timber floors. The worst part is the wheels get bunched up with hair every run so they wont glide smoothly, you cant take them out to clean you have to get a small sharp knife or tweezers to get the hair out so the vacuum can move freely. The tile head does do a good job of shining up the tiles. Just a shame it's such a big job to clean the vacuum after each use. 2 batteries are amazing, we only use one and it does our large 2 story home no problem. We had to have the tile head replaced after it stopped working but the customer service was excellent. They sent out a replacement with no issues, we simply had to send a photo and receipt."
241,3,"Disappointed with the suction powerI am sort of happy with the Stick Vack, just disappointed when vacuuming my car and cobwebs in the house and realised that the suction power is not very good. This was only my first week of using the vac, so the filter etc. still clean. I am considering returning it as this was one of the main reasons I purchased the vac. I wonder if an upgraded model will have better suction? However, I am happy with the double batteries and that it is easy to use."
242,3,"Very good until it isn'tI loved this vacuum cleaner. Yes it needed to be cleaned thoroughly every time the self-cleaning sensor started activating otherwise the machine would be stopping every couple of minutes to clean itself. However, what has really disappointed me, is that I spent around $700 on this appliance, which included a 7 year replacement warranty. The warranty ended in March 2021; The vacuum's motor gave up the ghost in June 2021 leaving me with a dead vacuum. I phoned Bosch customer service and the lady referred me to another department. I wrote them an email describing what went wrong (the motor started making a funny noise, suction was lost and a strange burning smell was being emitted). They didn't even reply my email, instead they sent me the circular mesh-like filter, which is useless and actually insulting. Anyway, $700 for a vacuum cleaner, one would expect it to make to ten years of service at least!
I won't be buying Bosch again."
243,1,DisappointingPurchased because of the reputation but it only works for eight seconds at a time then shuts down and drops all the dirt you've cleaned up back on the carpet ( even after Ive emptied it and cleaned it out.)
244,1,"For use on Carpet this has major design flaws, not fit for purposeFirst, this scathing review is for use as a Carpet cleaner. From my limited use of it as a hard surface cleaner I find it very good and possibly excellent.
Purchased this from HN Nunawading earlier this year. I had immediate issues so went back and spoke to the Dyson rep in the store. He told me that my problems were because I was vacuuming new carpet and the Dyson was only designed to work on carpet where only fine dust was lifted??!! I looked through all the pre-purchase literature from Dyson and no mention that this carpet cleaner couldn't actually work on any carpet that sheds which is what many carpet varieties do for the term of their life and not just when new.

In any case how can you describe something as a carpet cleaner when you yourself admit it wont work properly on new carpet that sheds.

I then replied to Dysons post sale email request for feedback and told them my problems and they asked for further of my details before they addressed the issue.

After I gave them that I got an email back letting me know I was signed up to them in some way and that was it.

No follow up at all. Lazy, incompetent and not giving a stuff once they had my money.

Here is the list of issues which mainly concern the collecting bin which:

Most Major issue (photos taken at different times attached)
a) Extraction bin sucks extracted material way above the 'max' half way line well before the bin is half full (including hair) and sometimes the unit shuts down because it says the suction pathways are blocked.

Indeed the pathways /suction hole inside the dust collector assembly are blocked with a ton of stuff as per the photo attached (and I have others)

Both these interconnected problems indicate not fit for purpose design. To repeat I never let the bin fill above the half way 'Max' line but well before the bottom half of the collector is full kit has sucked a ton of stuff above the 'Max' line.

Apart from clogging things up this means the bin has to be emptied continually which is a an absolute pita especially on rainy cold days (not that is is big enough collector anyway for anything a a little fluffy / bulky being vacuumed, it would still fill pretty quickly).

In store rep said this would stop when carpet pile was no longer being shed by the carpet. News Flash, this never stops with any carpet we have owned which means it will probably always block

But again in any case, it's sold by Dyson as a premium Carpet cleaner so it should be designed so this isn't an issue or else this limitation should be clearly spelled out to anyone considering purchasing it. Our old corded Sorma vacuum is totally basic but has no issues with any of this. We purchased this to have cordless.

b) According to the instore Dyson rep (who inspected the problem with my bin after use on my carpet) the slightest moisture causes extraction bin to not work properly and can contribute to the problems in a). He insinuated that was what had happened with mine - NO IT DIDN'T - but in such a top range machine why does this design supposedly have such basic limitations.

Smaller gripes:
c) Extraction bin is awfully clunky and messy to empty with such carpet vacuuming (see photos). Probably works fine with hard floor dust but I always have to actually disassemble the collector form the motor as the rubbish wont shake out. The carpet is not so new anymore but problem persists.

d) Extraction bin despite the unit having a hepa filter will release heaps of house dust and allergens when being emptied particularly as described in c).

e) Motor & Dust extraction assembly is somewhat too heavy and some profit needs to be shedded by Dyson and the customer put first rather than just marketed bs speak by using more expensive but much lighter components.

f) clipping accessories off and on is way to dodgy and sometimes takes way too long and is very fiddly.

g) picking up of stuff on the carpet is good but not always and should be better at this level eg bits of leaves or twigs.

h) the basic accessory holder slots on the charger are too close too be useful for more than 1 item at a time in practise when you have two large head accessories.

i) the small conical power brush head is not great at extracting surface bits and pieces off our carpeted stairs which is its main use for us and the stiff brush accesory doesn't work the best either. Do like the flexi wwand and soft brush

There must be a fix for this Dyson!"
245,1,"absolut disappointmentFlimsy build quality; and absolute rubbish at picking up. On hard floors, I thought I must be doing something wrong as I watched pieces of fluff being chased and blown away all over the floor - in fact anywhere other than up the vacuum cleaner. It is hard to clean, I agree with other comments that the fiddly nature of the movement to clear any blockages leads to one inadvertently flinging dust into the air. This product is TOTALLY unsuitable for hard floors. Especially unsuited to wooden stairs. All my comments are carefully considered as we have owned this for over 12 months. The changing of heads is fiddly and awkward. The bizarre wheels assembly on the turbo head has just broken on one side. For $1500, it is nowhere near as good a cleaner as my Miele corded vacuum costing $750. We even bought extra warranty (another $250!) making the total investment $1699! It should be called “Dyson V15 detect absolut disappointment.”"
246,1,"A Significant DisappointmentI have the v15 coming from the very first upright the DC15 which was still going until we got flooded. To be honest I think the v15 is a step down from the decades old model we had. Certainly doesn’t perform anywhere near as well, struggles to pick things up effectively. Trying to vacuum some spilt dry coffee grounds with the crevice tool leaves a bit behind. Have to be content with going back to a dustpan to get it all. High power mode is a must so your runtime is measured in minutes and then the battery is flat most of the time. I would say steer clear of cordless and consider the alternative options carefully. We paid $1399, which is a very significant outlay to be so disappointed."
247,1,"Piece of junkConks out after 10 seconds have to wait a couple of seconds pull the trigger only for it to conk out after a few seconds again. Took it back to the good guys Campbelltown under extended warranty for repair which took a month, get home and it’s even worse now. I want my money back or replaced but they won’t unless the same issue is repaired three times. No offer for a temporary vacuum. $1500 for a piece of junk."
248,1,"There’s nothing I like about this vacuumuI absolutely hate this vacuum, I wish I had my 7 back. It is next to impossible for me to detach the top part to empty the bin or use the hand vac. It is extremely loud and sucks up all my through rugs. I’m going to see if I can return it but I think it’s past the date?"
249,1,"A disappointing waste of money!Buying the Dyson V15 has been an expensive mistake! Emptying it is such a chore, it certainly doesn’t fall out easily like in the Dyson promotional videos. Every time I attempt to empty it, it involves banging it several times on the wheely bin, resulting in dust flying in my face (great for my allergies and defeating the point of having a HEPA filter), and then having to manually remove the hidden pockets of fluff and hair clogged in the nooks and crannies with my hand - it’s disgusting!
But to be honest I don’t have to worry about emptying it anymore as I gave up on using it shortly after purchase! Every single time I use it.. it comes up with a jammed error message and stops working, regardless if it’s just been cleaned!

Such a disappointing waste of money! :( I have gone back to my old Miele vacuum (which I luckily didn’t get rid of) as it’s 100% more reliable and easier to empty!"
250,1,"Disappointing on tile and timber floorsLooking at the demonstration video I now understand why, when using the laser head to highlight the dust, they vacuum in a forward direction. When you push the unit forward and then pull it backwards, like when you normally vacuum, the light highlights the dust that hasn't been vacuumed up by the unit. It's a gimmick and doesn't do the job.
I tested it out by using my soft fibre mop (approx $30) and then using the laser light head (Dyson unit $1400). The soft fibre dry mop did a way better job.
The Dyson works well on carpet but it's not worth it if you have hard flooring. It's certainly not worth the price tag.
The unit is also not lightweight and your finger can get pinched in the operating button.
10 Feb 2023 - I also tried leaving a review on the Dyson website but it wouldn't submit."
251,1,Does the job but the worst design to hang on for a period of timeIt does the job but the way its design it gave me a blister in two spots.
252,1,"Terrible costume service!You definitely would expect more for a product that cost more than $600.
I’ve had mine for barely one year, and I only use it once a week tops. The battery won’t hold for more than 3 minutes. That is definitely a problem on the battery so I sent it to Warranty. It’s been 4 weeks and I heard nothing back from them. I contacted Dyson and there is nothing they can do for me. Didn’t even offer to lend us a random vacuum. I haven’t clean the carpet for 4 weeks and I have two cats at home. I can’t describe how frustrating this situation is. Don’t go with Dyson!!"
253,1,"Better batteryI have V8 cordless vacuum. Battery life always was cr#p. Went on E bay and purchased a aftermarket one. Best thing I ever did. New battery is a 6000mAh compared to Dyson's 2800mAh. Never flattened the new one yet. Easy to install. Remove 3 screws, pull old battery out and reverse procedure and charge to fill."
254,1,"5 stars quickly deteriorated to 1 starIf I’d written a review anytime in the first month or so it would have been 5 stars all the way.
18 months in and have had to replace entire Vacumn head (under warrenty) but now the battery is lucky to last 30 seconds. There’s troubleshooting to follow and that has worked but still I can’t use for more than a min and a half or so before it’s completely dead. For $743 and watching the capabilities of it deteriorate from 2-3 months in, I feel really ripped off. My old vacumn which I’ve dug back out even has a light on the floor but which is so helpful for animal hair. I’ve got most Lino floors.
I think the great reviews are from people who have just purchased and negative ones are people who have had the unit 6+ months. They are some fabulous stick vacuums for sale now at 1/4 of the price."
255,1,This particular Model needs some modificationsI purchased Dyson Model 448588-01 in December 23. Initially happy with the power and ease of control. After a couple of uses I found the motor kept stopping and starting as if the dust chamber was full. On closer inspection I discovered that lint particles were trapped in the upper chambers and virtually impossible to remove. After many attempts I had to use a wooden skewer to remove lint/dirt from each chamber which takes 10-15 mins to fully clean. I checked with another Model and this is not a problem as that particular chamber is sealed. Extremely unhappy with this particular Model. Would appreciate some assistance as how to fix this problem.
256,1,"Worst product ever hands down!Had this overpriced worthless paperweight for 12 months now. 2 and half minutes vacuum time before needing 8 hours charge! Beyond pathetic, bordering on fraud selling this complete junk!
Will never ever even entertain the thought of buying a dyson, will demand family and friends to steer clear and will warn anyone about the utter garbage if I see them purchasing. So bad it's put me on a mission!"
257,1,"Made scratches on our floorThe battery life is disappointing, using it on max only lasts 2 minutes! The head also stops rotating now and then for no obvious reason. But worst of all is that it makes scratches on our wooden floor, and I can’t find out why. So we’ve stopped using it. Would not recommend."
258,1,"Battery of my V6 Absolute MAXI have one.
My daughter has one.
My friend has one.
In our experience.
The battery died completely after a couple months.
They all stopped working.
We all live in different states."
259,1,"Really poor productVery bad for elbows as it’s heavy at the top (no I’m not elderly) and has almost no suction. If it weren’t for the spinning brush it would do nothing. After 12 months light use the head sensor switches it on off randomly even though it’s clean. Really rubbish, I prefer the 5 yr old Aldi stick cleaner (and that’s no good but it’s better than this!!!)"
260,1,"Poor performance, endless frustrationI purchased the Dyson V7 from Bunnings Kingaroy reduced from $649 to $399 in November 2023. I have had endless troubles with it. Consulting Dyson customer service was of zero benefit. I have just on weekend returned it to Bunnings for a refund which they gladly provided. The problems I had were:
1. The dust container /canister opened randomly spilling the entire vacuumed contents on the floor
2. The suction was extremely low, causing me to chase around over and over the same area on my tiles endlessly
3. Things that were drawn up into the wand and power head fell out again when the battery stopped.
4. Harder items such as spilt coffee beans vacuumed, shot out like missiles in a zillion tiny pieces all over the floors causing even more mess & more time to clean & more distress
5. Changing over to the light brush attachment was useless for cleaning dead flys or dust from window sills. No suction at all. I ended up sweeping the sills with a baby bottle brush and picking up in paper towel.
6. Vacuuming carpet was better than vacuuming tiles but still weak suction.
7. The power mode switch only worked randomly part way through the vacuum house task but it made a choking noise and stopped every time. I eventually stopped using that function. On investigation and inspection nothing was stuck, the filter clean, nothing interfering with the expected performance as the non power switch worked without the choking noise.
The good things about it was cleaning the filter and it was easy to charge the vacuum with charging station. I liked pulling the dirt bin handle from the top because you don’t have to take off the wand to do it like Dysons other models, albeit the random opening of the V7 dirt canister."
261,1,"Started great… now not so great!Purchased our first ever Dyson 14 months ago & now it’s battery only last 10-15mins on max and the motor heats up while vacuuming, which is right above the handle so my hand feels the heat.
Is this a common issue? Do I have to replace the whole thing????"
262,1,"Vacuum disperses more debris than it eliminatesIncredibly disappointing product. I spent extra for the model with the head attachment for cleaning hard floors.
I've stopped using it completely as it just creates more mess. It disperses more debris across the room than it manages to eliminate. Very ineffective."
263,1,V7 Cordless Vacuum - Complete Waste of moneyI bought the V7 cordless vacuum relying on the brand name but regret it. Barely lasted 2 years before it started cutting out after one minute and stopped charging for no reason at all. This appears to be a widespread problem with the Dyson cordless vacuum so why they are still selling it is a mystery to me. Money completely wasted and had to buy a new vacuum. Went with different brand and will never buy Dyson again.
264,1,"Not a good product at all, very low run timeNot a good product at all, good when it works but have had problems with it not holding charge ever since purchase few months back. Have already had battery replaced once to no avail. Would not recommend, lucky if it holds charge for 5 mins so not long enough to get anything much done. Steer clear."
265,1,Battery appears designed to failBattery regularly fails every 2-3 years. I have older Dyson hand-held models where the battery is still operating fine after 10+ years. It appears the newer batteries are designed to fail around 24 months (but comes with a handy 12 month warranty). I have replaced the battery on this machine now 3 times.
266,1,"worst vacuum cleaner ever owned!keeps cutting in and out.
vacuum dust bin is way too small and only works when totally empty.
charging base is too loose and needs a piece of cardboard sat underneath the unit to sit it up and charge it, or the actual charging point doesn't reach.
worst vaccum cleaner ever owned, don't believe the hype!"
267,1,"Terrible vacuum cleanerI was told buy a Dyson it will change your life, what a disappointment.
Purchased as advertised great for animal fur/hair. Underwhelming and not worth the cost, after 3 years of disappointment I’m heading to another brand that works as is advertised."
268,1,Dyson V7 overpriced junk!!!This cordless vac cant even clean a 2 bdrm appartment before its battery runs out and takes hours to recharge. It also does not pick up lots without going over it from different directions a dozen times. A better real vaccuum cleaner with cord leaves this piece of junk for dead!!!
269,1,"The worst customer service I have ever come across!!!!I bought the v7 2 years ago I've had so many problems with it I've been in the phone with customer service for hours on at some times trying to fix the problems they've sent out different parts for the issues just to shut me up instead of replacing it because clearly there's a fault, so last night the vacuum made a loud explosion like noise and fire/ smoke was coming out of it and when I emailed them and told them they didn't care at all to ask about my well being or my children who have asthma and if we are ok instead [Names Removed] who's supposed to be the highest manager for Dyson said yep we'll asses the problem and you need to pay for the repairs after the vacuum Basildon exploded on me!!! Wowwwwww I'll be taking them to court."
270,1,"Battery fails to hold charge, I’ll never touch Dyson againWell, Dyson have completely screwed the pooch with this latest ballsup of a product.
I must have purchased it a few years ago now, but it fails to hold charge. I wouldn’t have used this more then 100 times, if that. Modern lithium batteries are meant to last 300-500 cycles, so there’s no excuse.

It runs for about 10 seconds, from being plugged in for hours “charging”. If I plug it back in and charge it and the. Use it immediately, it runs as expected. So, it clearly has a drain problem within the circuitry. Who designed this??? They need to be fired.

What blows my mind is that, in the past, Dyson had a good reputation for quality durable goods. This product is far from that. Clearly they’ve used inferior parts, and haven’t done the basics of quality control. A total opposite of what this company is meant to represent.

Many reviews on here state the exact same issue.

Due to this, I’ll never, ever, buy a product of theirs, ever again. Did I say ever enough?

Good work Dyson. You’ve screwed yourself and all your customers in the process. Goodbye. You’re dead to me now."
271,1,"Great at marketing , Equally worse at quality and supportBought this product and before the warranty period it's falling apart. After parts replacement by dyson still not workable and it good looks as a trophy at home."
272,1,"Can't Even Get Hold of Dyson On the Phone!My Dyson V7 has been frustratingly breaking down for a few months now, running for only a minute or so.
Have been trying to call Dyson to effect warranty however, the calls keep failing!, tried again and again, hopeless, a waste of my time! I am reading on reviews it is likely that the battery needs replacing and then when the battery is replaced its none the better. Dyson, what are you doing? Answer your phones!"
273,1,Appalling deviceUsed daily. Battery failed within warranty period. Dyson replaced the battery which again failed just outside the warranty. They are obviously using low grade lithium batteries. Not acceptable for such an expensive vacuum.
274,1,"Dyson v7 stick vacuumI purchased a Dyson v7 stick vacuum 2 years ago, I would never buy another one. According to their website the battery takes 3.5 hours to charge and gives 40 minutes of powerful suction. I could never get mine to last longer than 25 min on the powerful suction mode. If on Max suction, it lasts 10 seconds - I timed it!
The powerful suction mode is not powerful, useless on low pile carpet, only reasonable on tiles as the suction will not pick up everything. I get more suction from a B&D Dustbuster. Very disappointed in this product."
275,1,"Disappointed!Have had many Dyson handheld models over the years but first time one hasn't come with a crevice tool! $400 dollar machine and I'm supposed to now pay more for something that almost every other vacc brand comes with standard - poor form....
Plus this model seems to have an unnecessarily harder bin empty mechanism (esp. for those with elderly or weaker hands)."
276,1,2years old replaced battery 3 xI’ve replaced the head with a soft head which is much better on hardwood floors. I have also had to replace the battery 3x. I wouldn’t recommend this vacuum to anyone.
277,1,"Battery started to playing around as soon as it is out of warrantyI had the same issue with the Dyson v7 battery before and Dyson replaced it as it was under warranty. The new replacement battery comes with 2 years warranty and the same issue happened with the replacement battery too. Its my unfortunate that this happened as soon as the 2 years passed. Now, they want me to pay $129 for the battery which they know has issues. The same issue happened to 2 of batteries that means its manufacturing fault. When I approached Dyson they wiped off their hands by saying that its out of warranty and we can't do anything. I tried to make my point that as per ACCC rules, based on the cost of the product, it should last reasonable time even after its warranty period.
Dyson wants me to pay $129 after every 2 years as soon as the battery is out of warranty as apparently, this issue is with battery manufacturing process.

ISSUE: The machine stops working even if it is fully charged, then the machine has to be connected with charger for 1 sec in order to use it again."
278,1,The Dyson V7 works well BUT the battery is rubbishWe have had a Dyson V7 and although the machine vacuum works very well the battery is absolute crap. This is the second Dyson battery operated appliance we have had and it will be the last.
279,1,"So not happyA full charge only does 15/20 mins at the most , cuts in and out all the time , ive had 3 dysons and keep saying i will never have another ."
280,1,"Once a great company, now terribleLike so many, owned for 6 months before it started to clog up and cut out regularly (every 5-6 sec), pulled it apart and cleaned thoroughly, only for it to continue. Contacted Dyson, who ask for video evidence. Once provided, send out a new replacement battery. Which does nothing, problem still exists... so now we're waiting for a completely new replacement body that I'll have to take apart. They advised 2-3 weeks for the part, after this time passed another SMS to say the same length of time again. SMS states respond with any questions... except they don't reply. Why offer? Why not say, unmonitored?
Dyson won't acknowledge the problem, or replace the whole unit. They used to be a reputable brand. Not worth the money!"
281,1,"How to fix a DysonBadly designed and badly made:- not worth the huge price. They break and are expensive to repair. If they were made properly there would be no need.

282,1,"Expensive vacuum, many problemsWithout a doubt the worst vacuum I've ever owned. Constantly stops while vacuuming, gets clogged easily, and struggles to lift even small bits of kitty litter off a very low-pile rug. We got this to replace our V8 and it has been worse in every single way.
We use this vacuum on:
- hardwood
- low-pile rugs
- low-pile carpet

It is equally mediocre at all options. I've never used a vacuum that randomly switches off while using it, but that is the constant, tedious experience I've had with it. The vacuum will simply stop running until you release the trigger and pull it again. No amount of cleaning or battery re-seating fixes this.

The design is also extremely prone to clogs. We use it to get pet hair from a cat and a small dog, and it regularly gets clogged in the outlet in the chamber. I've had to stop, reach in, and physically remove buildups with my fingers."
283,1,"Don’t waste your money on a dyson stick vacuumV10 absolute Rubbish. Don’t waste your money. My daughter tried to warn me that they are [Content Removed].
I have owned 2 Dyson barrel vaccuum for 20+ years they are great.
My Aldi Robovac is 10000 times better."
284,1,"Dont buy a Dyson Stick vacuumBought 8 months ago, motor has been replaced, battery has been replaced, now waiting 4 weeks for a new charger. Have rebuilt it bit by bit. Been out of action 7 weeks while waiting for parts."
285,1,How the mighty have fallenThis vacuum was amazing to start with but quickly become terrible. The original battery lasts less than 5 minutes on turbo mode as the medium mode was insufficient to collect small debris. Eventually died and was replaced only for the same thing to happen again. Now it cuts out after 20 seconds and medium power only pushes the mess around on the flood. I need to sweep before i vacuum and anything bigger than a grain of rice is left behind. After reading multiple threads of people complaining about the same issue i feel like i have been ripped off. Unfortunately Dyson are now all hype but fail to deliver better results than a cheap corded vacuum. Its no wonder thy are now always going on sale. Spend your money elsewhere.
286,1,"False promotion - 5 minutes run time-reallyDyson and sales people ( Harvey Norman) should warn everyone up front that run time on a (brand new) machine is only 5 minutes! Why should a potential customer not assume that it should run for a reasonable amount of time and why should I know that its a question to raise ( assuming that an honest response will be forthcoming? When I buy a stove - I would'nt ask whether the baking temperature goes beyond 100 degrees!
I bought mine yesterday and was cleaning my not too messy car and it died after 5 minutes.
An !expensive mistake"
287,1,It is not worth itI’d had this about 2 and a half years and at first it was great but then it started to not pick things up. I clean the filter and it still does it. I have to go over a crumb 5 times for it to pick up. For $900 it is NOT worth it. A terrible vaccuum. I have to sweep after I vaccuum.
288,1,"Problems after 2 monthsWhile at first I was extremely happy with the suction and hair not getting tangled in the head, after 2 months the vacuum started cutting out constantly. The filter and canister have been cleaned and there is no blockage. Very frustrating to have what could be a great product fail after such a short time. Online research suggests this is a common problem - one that I wish I was aware of prior to purchasing."
289,1,Dyson The worst everDyson The worst ever This vacuumed is by far the hardest and the worst vacuum i have ever bought It is very hard to drag around the house /heavy to pull and to use I have wasted my well earned money buying this primitive machine I bought this 2-3 weeks ago and have struggled to use it all 3 times The lead is short and have to keep un plugging it and plugging it in every room it reaches to do one and a bit rooms at a time Changing the tools is not easy in any way the original tube shaped hover was much better in every way this will be on ebay soon but i think it will be hard to sell even on ebay I WILL NEVER BUY A DYSONEVER AGAIN
290,1,"A struggle to useI bought this vacuum just over 12mo ago with such high hopes being a Dyson.
We wanted a powerhead since we have long haired dogs. The hair tangles badly around the roller (need to use scissors to remove) but there is no loss of suction. Bonus.
Im on my 3rd roller brush since the brushes wear out and no longer brushes my carpet to pick up the dog hair. Replaced under extended warranty though. Bonus.
The roller balls fell off the wand after collecting hair that there was no way for me to access to remove. The entire head was replaced under warranty. Bonus.
The cannister holds heaps of dirt but over time is an effort to get shut after cleaning and once or twice removing it from the machine to empty has resulted in a giant mess and more vacuuming. Bonus.
The suction is amazing. The best yet, right up there with my previous Shark. Picks up everything, even leaves the dogs walk in. Although sometimes the roller pushes some items away and you have to chase them and put the vacuum head right over then to pick them up. And the downfall of having a powerhead that can't turn off its that you suck up anything with a pile and can't move despite having a suction reduction trigger. To vacuum mats I need to take the powerhead off and just use the nozzle. Bonus.
The machine itself is heavy to lug around, doesn't turn well and has sometimes driven me to tears, esp when I bumped and chipped our freshly painted wall tugging it in frustration to get it to move. Bonus.
Trying to clean cobwebs off the ceiling or dust from vent covers is also an ordeal. The hose is simply not long enough nor flexible enough. Just love that the machine rights itself. Bonus.
Well, we're going to try yet another vacuum to see if we can find something else that actually suits what it's marketed for.
I don't recommend this machine if you have long haired dogs (or kids) or any carpeted surfaces."
291,1,"Clogging, looses suctionVacuuming carpet the Dyson looses suction after about 2 minutes , I then empty the waste container clean/wipe around the metal filters with a damp cloth and away it goes for another 2 minutes, very frustrating"
292,1,worst vaccunm do not purchasei purchased this approx. 3 hours ago rom big w as my Dyson origin which is 7 years old finally died. I thought i wouldn't go wrong with purchasing another dynos. well how wrong was i!! it does not suck anywhere near as good and i am in shock that Dyson has actually produced this with such a large price tag. please don't purchase. ill be asking big for a refund tomorrow alternatively contacting Dyson direct.
293,1,"Worse vacuum everDyson should be ashamed, worse vacuum ever. If you have carpet do not buy, it has these little wheels on the vacuum head which digs in and causes havoc to the carpet. It also Doesn’t even vacuum hair up on carpet. If you also want to quickly vacuum a corner by taking the head of the vacuum there is gap in the hand piece (designed by someone that’s never done vacuuming). Do not buy unless you like being frustrated."
294,1,"Dyson quality has gone down hillI own multiple Dyson products but this one is by far the worst. Dyson cy22 animal pro…. Has just not lasted. The vacuum has continually lost suction, unlike my dc39 this vacuum does not have the option to clean the filters and I constantly have had problems with this model. Turbine brush stopped spinning and I’m not impressed at all. I have had a v6 dyson stick vacuum that has worked for years and now have a v8. This one however has been the most problematic of all the dyson products I have purchased…. Really disappointed"
295,1,"I just can't Believe that Dyson actually produced this Vacuum!!!Well I purchased this Vacuum Cleaner (Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Multi Floor Extra) back in February, 2023. I have to tell you that I can't believe that Dyson actually produced a vacuum cleaner like this one!! It is Terrible!! I have a Dyson Gen5 Detect Stick Vacuum that I use around my home - and it is a pleasure to use. Not the case with this Barrell Vacuum!! I purchased it from Dyson on EBay. I bought it mainly for 2 reasons. 1. To use to vacuum my car, and 2. to vacuum the carpets in my 3 bedrooms.
1. Trying to use it to vacuum my car is a nightmare. It never stays upright and always rolling over on it's side. If it hits the power cord it just won't move and you have to tug at it to get it over the cord. The handle design is an absolute pain to use - Dyson put so much into their Development of their products - and they come up with this design?? Trying to clean the dashboard of my car becomes impossible due to this poorly designed handle!! Trying to extend the tube to increase the reach needs help from a weight lifter - another poor design feature. The wrost part about this machine is the excessive cost of all the accessories. They fit in one way only and this is like a jigsaw. Definately not designed for an older Australian User.
2. I have tried many times to use it to vacuum the bedrooms in my home. It's like having a workout everytime that you use it. It requires so much pressure and does not ""Glide"" over the carpet like it should. My carpet is low pile so it shouldn't be an issue but it surely is!!

Without any exaggeration, this is by far the worst Vaccum Cleaner I have ever owned.

I am so disappointed with Dyson. I honestly can't believe that they produced this poorly designed and very frustrating vaccum cleaner!!

Buyer Beware. Purchase it at your own risk!!

Does Dyson offer Great Customer Service? Well I will wait and see - and then report back to you!!

Thnaks for reading ......."
296,1,"Hands down the worst vacuum I have ever purchasedThis thing flings dust and bird seed behind it, in front of it - EVERYWHERE!! Takes me 4-5 times as long to try and vacuum something.
Clunky and awkward head and handle. I have tried the two supplied heads and swapped to a turbo head. Avoid!
I will never buy a Dyson brand again"
297,1,"Not ergonomicThis vacuum does the job in terms of removing dust and debris from various surfaces. But the ridiculous handle design has given me the worst RSI. I'm in so much pain after using it only twice to vacuum my 3 bedroom house.. I couldn't even cut slices of cheese after damaging my wrist vacuuming in such an awkward position. A friend of mine experienced similar and now has a lump on her wrist!
There were other issues, like the flimsy extendible tube and the bulky head. But the pain from holding the handle is enough for me to get rid of this machine.
So disappointed."
298,1,"DisappointingWe have had this model's baby brother for a long time until the handle trigger cracked and duct tape was successfully used to repair. We replaced it with this Big Ball model, expecting the same or better performance. Wrong. The main body does not roll, you have to drag it behind you. Fluff and lint on carpet has to be picked up after you have vacuumed the area. Hopeless. I do like the easier chamber emptying feature and the quieter motor."
299,1,"Works till it doesn'tI have solid hardwood flooring so this vacuum get very little use. I bought the extended warranty. About 2 years ago it started blowing out dust on startup. I ultimately sent it in for repair. I got it back and it was still blowing out dust on startup. For the amount of money I paid, I expect much more.
Very disappointed..."
300,1,"Big mistakeAfter living with and loving the first dyson for many years before I was forced to retire it, I bought the new dyson cinetic big ball animal pro believing it to be a new and improved model...improved no way!! The attachments are awkward and time consuming to use, the spinning brush head bristles broke off and the 3 in one multi tool is ridiculously awkward to use and hair and fluff etc gets snagged on the many joins up the pipes and brush heads. The plastic body & barrel are flimsy and fragile and changing attachments and pipes take forever to slot together...what a disgrace! Saw 2 dyson vacuum cleaners in a charity shop 4 sale last week & they were still there yesterday...go figure!"
301,1,"Disappointing and useless since day 1Today the rewind died. Dyson service - no after hours - Chat does not work.
Vacuum is a few years old has been used about 125 times. Has never been any good on carpet.
Difficult to use/empty/noisy/and ineffective.
I have a Sanyo vacuum retired to the garage and it is over 30 years old and works perfectly. I am on my third Dyson hand held - which is why the “Big Balls up” has had little use. The hand-helds also die. Fantastic that other brands now make similar vacuums to Dyson.

Being creative, stylish, great for those who “look good” early adopters paying for the most expensive product and getting the hired help to use it - that is the Dyson target market. Not so great for those who thought they would get a superior product. Guess you pay for a Porsche/ Ferrari /Mercedes etc you expect a superior product - in Dyson’s case you do not get that."
302,1,"Unreliable careless serviceSince the day I purchased it has issues one after another. Recently suction wasn’t working and I asked for replacement and even opted upgrade. But agreed only for repair.
Finally I received the vacuum cleaner after the defect fix. I sent as a new machine, now after the repair it’s full marks and scratches.

Moreover, the machine so heavy that I started getting back pain after 30 minutes of carpet cleaning.

I’ll never buy their products"
303,1,"Dyson Cinetic™ Big Ball Barrel Vacuum , poor design & functionalitySo after 40 years of being a cleaner & using a variety of vacuums in my work and home I finally got talked into a Dyson by the salesperson. Instead of doing my usual research before buying and reading reviews I got talked into buying it in October 2021.
It is not til you get it home and use it that you realise how bad the design is. The head for carpets/rugs is about the only thing that works ok.
The head for floors is of poor design, the openings come out sideways and everything gets clogged up and you have to constantly unblock. This is a vacuum designed to deal with dog hair & the reason why I thought it would be a great buy. Heaven forbid you pick up anything like a leaf or you spend ages trying to unclog it. I have never had an issue with all the $300 vacuums I have bought in the past.
The On/Off button and retract cord button are very flimsy & unlike all other machines I would not use my foot as I believe they would break.
The worst thing is the chamber for the dirt, it opens ok but trying to close it took me ages to figure it out so that the bottom didn't open up each time you tried to remove it from the vacuum. All parts of this seem flimsy and likely to break. Trying to clean the filter is a nightmare, all my old machines I could wash out but this one I can't.
The wheels are badly designed and struggle to even go over a cord. Again a problem I have never experienced before.
After owning the $850 vacuum for only 8 months it stopped picking up and I took it back to the place I purchased and I had Concierge coverage, they took it for a service. This took 5 weeks & I fortunately had my old machine (that was still working fine) to use. Again I have NEVER needed to service any of my vacuums in the past.
As you can tell I would never recommend this vacuum. As you can probably tell.
Picture below so you can know what not to buy."
304,1,"Great Vacuum- until the NON EXISTENT FILTER needs replacingThe vacuum itself has been fantastic on hard floors with pet hair- until yesterday when the filter the vacuum is advertised as NOT HAVING has decided its full. Google searches later, I found a great video on replacing the post assembly filter that supposedly does not exist, however because I brought with product care I will need to get this done through a supplier to not void the warranty. My issue here is not so much the filter, but instead Dysons false advertising with the product itself, plus the absolute bother and cost to get the filter replaced every 12 months- had I have known this was the case I would have spent $850 On a vacuum that didn't have the long term costs involved."
305,1,"Further review of Cinetic Big Ball Animal cleanerI wrote a critical review of the cleaner when I purchased it in February 2022. Nine months later my impression of the cleaner has not changed. To empty the cleaner is an ordeal - there is always a mess, the component parts are difficult to connect. Help from Dyson recently with a problem was non-existent. I have had Dyson products in the past and have been pleased with them. Because of my experience with the current product I am critical of the company whenever I can."
306,1,"Waiting 5 months for a replacement!After a year my vacuum broke. I took to the Dyson authorize center. I have been waiting 5 months for a replacement. Every month I was told my machine will be delivered within 5 to 7 business days. I am still waiting, as of August 15, 2022, my replacement is on its way.... 10 to 15 days."
307,1,"Very Disappointed--Terrible Vacuumhad great suction first few times, THEN downhill from there, wheels are hard to maneuver around easily tips over, we have short pile carpet, thick pile rugs, wooden floors and tiles, 3 cats and a Maltese, doesn't have enough suction to pick up everything even small things, reason hubby purchased this was to make things easier BUT definatly does not make life any more easier. this was our first Dyson then decided to get another Dyson V10 stick vacuum. Will NEVER purchase another Dyson."
308,1,"Worst vacuum everPros: longer cord than previous one we owned (dc50). The button to wind the cord is useful.
Cons: design is bulky and hard to manoeuvre. Suction is simultaneously so hard it pulls the carpet up yet it misses half the crumbs etc and just flicks them around so when you look behind you to the section you have just vacuumed it is now dirty again. This is the same on carpet or tiles. It is quite a pain to move around as you are pulling a long stick which is attached to a barrel on wheels by a long tube and it’s awkward and when you turn corners the barrel knocks into the wall and damages it instead of following your path. Our previous one was an upright model and we had no complaints. It was serviced less than a year ago though then carked it and they wouldn’t do anything even though the warranty on the service is two years. So we were sold this as an upgrade as they have moved away from the upright model for some reason except for a basic one but we needed one for animal hair, and they said this was way better but to be honest it’s a dud and the worst vacuum we have ever had. It was so expensive and we were told buy Dyson, nothing else compares, but this is a real disappointment. Waste of our precious money."
309,1,Worst vacuum cleaner I've ever purchasedThe dust container never shuts properly it spits dust out the back its absolutely by far the worst vacuum cleaner I've ever used . I was a fan of Dyson until I purchased this don't waste your money you spend more having to hire a capers cleaner to pick up the mess it leaves behind
310,1,"Poor Product DesignThis vacuum is supposed to be top of the range. I've only had it for just over a year and it basically doesn't work anymore. I've cleaned the filter and emptied the bin regularly - but now it has no suction I'm really annoyed and want my money back.
UPDATE:

After 3 hours pulling all the components apart to see if I could locate the problem, I finally sorted it out. It was the handle which connects to the hose and the wand. A bottle top was stuck in there, blocking the cyclonic action and creating a build up of gunk - which is why the suction stopped working. I literally needed a torch and a skewer to get all the stuff out.

This is extremely poor product design. The handle can't be pulled apart and cleaned so if anything gets stuck in there it's difficult to locate and difficult to clean out. I'm no technician but I imagine if I had to get an expert to resolve the problem, they would charge about $150 per hour. Since I spent 3 hours, doing your job for you, I expect compensation to the value of $450 for wasting my time due to poor product development. Thank you."
311,1,"Weak suction and pet hair clogsHave owned this machine for a few years and the suctions seems to be getting weaker and weaker each time we use it. All of the heads are not suitable for long haired pets, constantly clogging and jamming.
Very disappointed with this (expensive) product and wouldn’t recommend to anyone. Don’t think my next will be a Dyson."
312,1,"Ruined my wool carpetPurchased our Dyson specifically for dog hair as we just had 100% wool carpet laid and our dogs hair was covering it. What we noticed was our wool carpet started fuzzing up it is now a big matted mess, it was obvious is was the vacuum head doing the damage. Dyson works ok on floors and rugs but avoid if you have wool carpet."
313,1,"Pretty Much UselessPurchased the above approx 3 years ago. Has to qualify as one of our worst purchases ever. Wheels keep falling off unit, the wheels on the power head fall and wont reattach and now the poer head has stopped working. Overpriced, overrated and underperfoming."
314,1,"Initially good now no sucking power and smellyInitially was a good vacuum on purchase, good suction, but after 2 years of near daily use and 2 replacement brush heads and a broken wand attachment plus now very poor suction And smelly I think it’s the last Dyson vacuum I’ll be buying. There’s also no way of cleaning the unit out so a build up of smelly dust etc inside that can’t get to to clean makes the house smell after vacuuming"
315,1,Not worth itThe vacuum does not pick up hair on carpet whereas cheep alternative does. Head completely broke off within two year warranty. Warranty only meets normal legislation of repair. Refused to give money back or even replace.
316,1,Waste of MoneyPaid $500 for this vacuum it barely sucks anything up from the carpet. Terrible has the quality of a $50 vacuum. Also it’s great to empty when dirt flies all over you.
317,1,"Worst vaccuam everDoesn't vaccuam carpet properly, head keep getting stuck. Very expensive vaccuam and very poor performance. Spoken to dyson helpline and there services are the most worst experience I ever had."
318,1,"Worst Dyson I’ve ever owned!I have used this twice. Can’t return to the shop as I don’t have the box. The pneumatic multi floor head is a complete disaster! It makes vacuuming carpets a nightmare. Instead of gliding over the carpet like every other vacuum I’ve ever used it lowers the blue strips that are supposed to be brushes and drags badly. Pushing the head is impossible. You have to lift, place it in position and pull heavily towards you. When it’s vacuuming the hard floors it’s almost the same and leaves trails of sand and dust that you you have to go over again and again. This is NOT a hair issue. After reading reviews (wish I’d read them first I would NOT have bought this one) I even went and bought the Tangle Free Turbine tool but it’s 1. Inflexible & 2. Tiny I can’t possibly vacuum a 2 story house with that! So disappointed as I love Dyson & currently own 2 other stick ones but need a corded one for the longer time to run."
319,1,"Piece of Junk........Stay away from DysonBought this Vacuum in 2019, paid top dollars however after approx 3 years of use, its motor has burnt out and warranty would not cover it (comes with 24 months warranty) either. I do not expect this to happen considering the amount i paid for this piece of junk. Even cheaper brands last longer than this.
Dyson might a good brand in the past......not anymore
Don't waste your money......stay away from Dyson"
320,1,"Motor has burnt out twiceI splashed out and replaced my 10yr old (still working well) Phillips, when the turbo head got worn with a Dyson. Friends had one for 20 years, and raved about the brand.
The first Dyson motor burnt out after 3? Years. Dyson tried blaming it on me, saying that I wasn’t emptying the canister (not true). Apparently a ‘full’ bucket is if any dust touched the inner filter when it is on an angle. We are talking one - two rooms max vacuuming here, filling the corner of the canister to 5cm.

The replacement vacuum has lasted 10 months before the motor again started to screech. This time I had been obsessive about emptying the canister (multiple times when vacuuming my house), removing all hair from the turbo head every week. The house is a clean house with four adults, and no pets. Yet still it fails.

Key faults appears to be that the pre motor hepa filter has been removed in the later models, and a woeful sized canister which has a pathetically weak clip keeping it closed. Making it even worse, the dust is held in the cyclone, not dropped into a separate compartment like other cyclone vacuums, hence the dust goes straight to the motor housing, and the customer gets blamed by Dyson!!

There is no way this vacuum is fit for purpose for a house with pets.

I will never ever ever buy another Dyson, it is a badly designed rip off, which does not have the robustness to justify the price.

The vacuum has been designed for good looks, and not functionality.

It has to be nursed along and treated with kid gloves to protect the motor from bad design.

My previous vacuum which was half the price leaves this one for dead."
321,1,"Read all reviews before buyingI bought this vacuum for use on carpet and wooden floors.
It works quite well on carpet but the links between the handle and hose, and hose and floor fittings whistle very loudly at regular intervals. I've managed to 'fix' this by putting tape around the joints. It still whistles occasionally, but is now a bit quieter.
On timber it has another problem, as the head leaves marks on the floor that you then need to wipe off with a wet cloth. Mopping alone won't remove the marks.
I have had the head replaced once under warranty, but the second head also leaves marks on the floor. See picture from last week attached. This seems to be a problem with the two 'wheels' on either side of the head, which continue to get clogged with human hair and carpet fibre (not pet hair as I don't have pets). I now have to unscrew and clean the wheels regularly just to stop the marking"
322,1,Dyson doesn't live up to the hypeFirst few times I had no complaints using this unit on tiled and carpeted areas in my new home but then the suction was average. Sent back to Dyson twice for service only to be told there is no issues. I have persevered but I certainly wouldn't rush to purchase another Dyson ever. A simple task of vacuuming a rug becomes an issue where you have to go over several times to pick up fluff etc. Very disappointing
323,1,"Over designed plastic junkWay over priced plastic junk! Long hair tangles up regularly in the power head and it's a pain to remove the power head turbine to remove the hair, it's not just a simply case of sliding out the cylinder brush. The cinetic ball is a filthy contraption to use. Who could possibly think emptying a canister full of fine dust and hair into a plastic bag or straight into their bin is hygienically clean in any way possible. Paper vacuum bags all way for me with high end US brands such Oreck or Hoover.
Get back to the drawing board Dyson geeks."
324,1,The suck on the vacuum don't last long enough and t he bush don't go aroundBoards and carpet don't like it never buy again the head of brush don't move make hard to vacuum so don't like this vacuum at all people ask me I say don't buy it
325,1,"Not the Dyson l knowI purchased the animal cinetic big ball barrel. I had it around three weeks but used it for just over a week. The pros were that the suction and tools are brilliant. But the unit is cheap and a poor quality product for the price. They have created a ridiculous system in order to empty the unit. You pull up a plastic bit, un clip the bottom, empty and then reclick back into place. The problem was after first emptying, the seal would not seal properly and dust leaked. The actual clip part is flimsy and the part you pull up gets stuck. The on and off switch is also flimsy. I sent the unit back and will be buying another more reliable brand. Such a shame as my last Dyson has lasted over ten years and l paid 300, this was 699 and honestly it’s not worth it. Such a shame for an iconic brand that has served so many so well for years. I hope Dyson take this onboard and consider a more robust model in the future. I do need to add that their customer service is brilliant"
326,1,"Hard to clean when no filters to wash-bad smellBought this new 3 months ago have used it daily and empty it every second day after vacuuming as I vacuum three times a day with children. It is hard not to vacuum it's now pumping out a really bad smell of dirty feet and has not come into contact with anything that could cause it and I've now found out that there is no washable filter on this chemisty so if I can't get rid of this bad smell, I'm going to have to buy another vacuum but it definitely won't be a Dyson this time."
327,1,"Not happy1. The dust bin's lid released open all of the contents as I disconnected from the unit. Happened twice! Massive mess to clean up. 2. The attachment adapter broke very early on in use. 3. It's short on suction power in general. 4. Dust bin gets clogged at the bottom in the narrowest part with the littlest debris, stopping the rotation of debris thus affecting its suction power. I have to empty out when its not even 'full' because of this blockage.
Poorly designed and manufactured. Not happy."
328,1,"Multifloor cleaner ...Doesn't live up to its nameNot well designed or made as the wheels fell off after using on tiles as the shank that hold the wheel to the heavy body is pencil thin plastic with a single screw through it and of course the shank snaps in half and can't be fixed.
Might be ok for carpet over a long period but not good for going from carpet to hard floor as the wheels can't handle it.
My machine maybe 3 years old but for the near $600 paid I would expect a lot longer life than that."
329,1,"No longer ‘Loving my Dyson V12’See part 2 after 12 months
Part 1. Light weight and easy to maneuver ..
has great suction .. easy to clean and makes vacuuming tiles to carpet a breeze.

Part 2. 12 months on battery needed replacement luckily still under warranty but I was shocked it lasted only a year and also even after thoroughly looking after masses of dust collects in small filter and clogs even if you empty and clean after each use.."
330,1,"Underwhelming for the price. Dyson missed the mark on this oneSo I have owned an old Dyson barrel vacuum for a little over 10 years that never skipped a beat and did an amazing job, didn’t require any replacement parts or anything. It was a weapon that paid for itself.
I no longer required such a vacuum and wanted to move towards the cordless variety as they’ve been around now long enough where they’re not a powerless secondary quick clean option with a weak battery life. And an ex had an older cordless Dyson (can’t remember which one it was but it was released 4-5 years ago) that was great and really surprised me, apart from the battery life.

I spend a few weeks doing my research on all the Dyson cordless options reading reviews and comparison test between each model as well as competitors. I also used Dyson’s own suggested vacuum questionnaire and even did this multiple times with some minor adjustments in my answers and everything pointed to the V12 detect slim. On paper my place was the ideal environment for it. Very a mall apartment, over 80% hard flooring (wood and tiles), carpets short and firm in both bedrooms, no pets or even a gf shedding hair and no kids or housemate making a mess.

First impression out of the box where it was smaller than I anticipated by maybe 10% but I don’t have much mess to clean, and even if I did, I wasn’t bother if I would have to empty the bin mid vacuum as that’s so simple to do. But overall the build quality was great and what I would expect from a Dyson. The charging stand was a great addition as I rent and don’t want to be installing wall mounts etc. so overall really happy out with my purchase. The weight is super light and it’s very ergonomically designed. It looks great even set up on its stand in the living room.

Things changed when I used it though. I found it was nowhere near powerful enough when using on hard flooring. Maybe the laser isn’t such as good idea as I was able to see maybe 20% of the dust left behind that I might of otherwise not seen. It never felt clean enough to mop, using a conventional mop as to me it felt like there was too much dust left behind.

On the 3 times I did use it I had the roller stop rolling when I went over the floor mat that inside my front door (no blockages observed, and the one blockage I did have from a 20c coin the rollers actually kept spinning) which is almost like cardboard it’s that thin. The roller wouldn’t start rolling again even when spun manually and when I put it in boost mode. *Note this mode drains the battery like nothing else as I even tried using that manually, and it’s not a solution an all. The only way to get the roller to start again was to shut the machine down and restart it. I also tried to vacuum a small thin dead and brittle leaf that was by my front door. It wouldn’t have a bar of it. Didn’t register a blockage, just wouldn’t pick it up. It should have has no problem with it with how small and brittle it was.

Also I used the small brush tools to do a few simple things like cleaning keyboards and that also was terrible.

Oddly though the large carpet head did well on my carpets. Not exceptional but good enough. This makes me feel like maybe there’s an issue where on hardwood, tiles and any unbroken surfaces like keyboards etc it doesn’t really create a seal of sorts like it does on carpet and it’s not powerful enough to compensate for that lack of Venturi effect.

I will say this though Dyson do have a 45 day return policy. I reached out via email and no crap from their side that most companies do when returning a product that didn’t deliver. There is no cost on my end to return, which is also a trick that gets used to discourage returns. I had thrown out all the packaging as I didn’t have space to leave it around and to be honest based my own experience with Dyson I wasn’t expecting to be returning the product. I was offered 2 options, one where they would send a box to me that I could return the vacuum in, or alternatively they gave me the address to their nearest brick and mortar store where I could return it.

So look overall I think this vacuum isn’t primary vacuum material, especially if you rent and have inspections. I do think it’s role would be that of a secondary vacuum for quick little jobs, but at the price it’s not something I could justify and I think quite a lot of people also couldn’t as a secondary appliance. But if the price isn’t an issue the yeah it would be great for little jobs around the house inbetween your normal cleaning cycle. I think they missed the mark slightly on the V12 detect slim. If the price point was 60-65% lower then they’d probably have a little gem on their hands.

And like I said Dyson’s support staff were easy to deal with, (my initial email was a little heated regretfully) but they were really nice and helpful when realistically the could’ve messed me around as I was close to the end of my return window. So yeah disappointed but not bitter."
331,1,"Dyson, other products now can empty bin automatically …I was exciting getting it as my old dyson was not wireless. After using it for a period of time, there were more negatives i can find using it:
1.i have to use strong suction to get a clean carpet hut that only last 15 minutes, then it will ask to be charged .
2. When comes to empty the bin, i have to empty it outdoor. Otherwise all dust is will spread and i. I need to revaccum them again. So what s the point?
3. It s not easy to empty the bin, getting my fingers in to remove and take out all it out.
For a price you re charging, it s indeed a dissapointing invention. The only pro i can find is it s wireless and lightweight."
332,1,"6 weeks of light use and the cordless stick has snapped off in halfPurchased from JBHIFI for an eyewatering $1300.
6 weeks into light usage on floor boards ( no carpet), the main barrel and the cordless stick have snapped. As mentioned, light usage and the plastic inside the tube clean snapped from the main barrel. We have not dropped or ""possibly smashed it against the wall"" as suggested by Jb hi fi customer service.
We are then charged $65 to have it assessed ( under warranty) and 8 week wait to determine if the Dyson is faulty or we broke it. So we now need to buy a temporary Vaccum whilst we wait for their decision.....
dont waste your money on this product."
333,1,"Why I'm returning my Dyson V12I’ve always wanted a cordless stick vacuum, even though I already have a ducted vacuum and an 8-year-old Dyson barrel vacuum. I am so happy with my Dyson barrel that I knew my stick vacuum had to be a Dyson as well. Over the years every time Dyson brought out a new stick vacuum I would race down to a stockist to test it, only to leave empty-handed as they were all too heavy for me and I recognised straightaway that pressing the lever down for the duration of vacuuming would be uncomfortable for me.
When the Dyson V12 came out I couldn’t believe my luck, finally a lighter vacuum with a button, and a bonus led light! But that joy soon dissipated as its flaws became evident. I would like to be fair and congratulate the Dyson team for producing a stick vacuum that is light and easy to manoeuvre around, and the green led light really does help you see all the dust particles that you would not normally see. So why am I returning it?

I think a lot of people would find the bin size too small, but that’s not my problem with the bin. The bin unevenly distributes the debris that’s sucked up into it, which mostly goes towards the back of the bin, and half the debris bypasses the rubber seal and goes into the top of the bin. And, unlike as you will see it advertised where a simple push of a lever expels the debris, the debris actually gets stuck. You have to actually stick your fingers in the bin to get all the debris out. Then even worse than that, you then have to completely disassemble the bin further to get the rubbish out of the top half of the bin. I’ll attach photos to help you understand what I’m saying. Seriously, when you’re paying over $1000 for a vacuum you shouldn’t be expected to stick your fingers in a bin to clean it. It’s quite gross!

The next problem I have with it is it isn’t capable of vacuuming a shag or long pile rug. One of my three rugs is a shag-type rug. When you use the direct drive cleaner head on it it works for two seconds and then the bar just stops rolling. You can hear the motor still working but the turning mechanism doesn’t move and therefore nothing gets sucked up. I know that the new omni-glide states that it’s for hard floors only, but I can’t see anything regarding the V12 not being able to vacuum a high pile carpet. It just doesn’t, which means I have to pull out the old Dyson barrel vacuum to vacuum that rug. Really there needs to be something written stating that this machine does not work on long pile carpet. Another fun fact, if you read the print on the brochure that comes with it, you are not supposed to use this vacuum in bathrooms either.

The other thing I noticed is when you attach any of the “grey” coloured attachments the suction isn’t great at all. I went to vacuum the floor of my car, which wasn’t that dirty, utilising the grey attachments and it barely sucked anything up. However, when I attached the motorised hair screw it did work, but I wanted to reserve that piece for my white sofas and just rely on the “grey” coloured tools, especially the crevice tool, for my car. You need to be able to use a crevice tool on a car floor because there are narrow awkward areas that the other tools won’t reach. I ended up pulling out my old Dyson barrel vacuum again and the crevice tool on that sucked everything up immediately. It also would have been nice if the illuminated crevice tool was included in the price. I actually thought I was getting that, as all the Dyson clips on YouTube give you the impression it is included.

I think people would find the battery length efficient but I actually thought it was going to last 60 minutes. The 60-minute battery length refers to when you use the eco mode, and, let’s face it, one of the advanced features of this Dyson is its ability to adjust suction according to what’s on the floor and what surface it’s on, which it will only do on Auto mode. Auto mode only lasts 35 minutes. I live in a small townhouse and 35 minutes does do my floors and staircase, but then I run out of battery to do my sofas and dining chairs and any other small jobs, so once again out comes the old Dyson barrel. I think ""three strikes and you’re out"" applies at this point.

So, in my opinion, any stick vacuum over $1000 should provide 60 minutes of run time on auto mode (perhaps include an additional battery in the package), be able to work on long pile carpets (or advertise that it doesn’t do so), have good suction whilst using the grey accessory tools and have a bin that really does expel the rubbish in the way it advertises it does. Sorry, but I’m returning this and cross my fingers that one day in the future these things can be improved upon, and then I will go back and buy a better version of this light, push button Dyson."
334,1,"You are kidding, right?I will admit that i have never bought into the whole Dyson fad but with the housemate buying the latest and greatest V12 offering from them it was a chance to fully evaluate it.
The results were not great to say the least.
I will say that, as with most cordless tools, convenience and ease of use are good, but as for performance there is much to be desired.

When used on a hardwood floor it will eventually pick up much of the dust, but when i pulled out an old $60 Woolworths corded vac for comparison the Dyson was immediately outclassed.

As for use on carpet it pales by comparison when you stack it up against a GOOD vacuum cleaner. It can't even compete against an el'cheapo.
I would rate it's suction a 4 out of 10.

Sure, it has many gimmicky things that are totally worthless and people might think it's design is funky, but it really is pretty woeful in carrying out it's designed function.

The dust container is the size of a thimble.
The need to continually empty it is compounded by the fact that (despite dysons claims) you have to disassemble it and scoop out any debris with your fingers.

Dysons claim to fame originally was being bag less, but even this is an exercise in marketing designed to fool the ignorant. I was using bag less vacuums 40 years ago.

Honestly, there is nothing much to recommend this product.
It's performance is sub-par (and that's being incredibly generous) and it is over priced beyond belief.
I have no doubt any of the other cordless vacuums on the market would easily perform to the same level as this machine and cost a third of the price.

If you have money to burn and want to get sucked into a gimmick then knock yourself out and get one of these.
If you actually want a vacuum that does what it's meant to then look elsewhere."
335,1,"Not suitable for Dog Hair or Long Hair!I purchased this for my home which is wholly hard floor. We have 2 small dogs and unfortunately their dog hair gets caught in the fours wheels of the head and we have had a terrible experience with this vacuum. The suction is not strong enough. We have contacted Dyson on numerous occasions who have sent out a new head. This is such a waste of time, expense and waste of materials as it was as though we use it for a month and throw out the head. They are happy for us to keep doing that as opposed to coming up with a new solution for us. I hope you really consider purchasing another Dyson if you have dog hair!
Other things to note is the product is very lightweight easy to use, battery life is limited and you have to be quick, dust bin is small but manageable if you empty it as you go. Although my husband struggles with emptying it as he can’t get his hand in it.

Bottom line - Buy the v8 or above!"
336,1,"Do not buyI love Dyson products but this is our first major disappointment. The castors get clogged within 1 week or two making the vacuum useless. After the castors get all clogged up you cant even move the thing across the floor. Furthermore, the rollers get all clogged up and stop turning. You have to turn it on and off constantly to get them moving again. No point buying this product"
337,1,"Good Product but with a GatchaWe are 2 people living in a small apartment with hard floors and the Omniglide’s size, battery capacity, etc. are ideal but there’s one big gotcha - The little castors get clogged with hair and seize after about 3 months of routine use. Dyson sent out a replacement set but are now saying it’s a maintenance issue not a manufacturing fault so won’t replace again. It’s not possible to pull the castors apart and clean them. Unfortunately they are now out of stock so buying 4 sets to replace them as a consumable item isn’t going to work for the time being. I’m now concerned that the device will mark the floors given the castors are jammed so it’s staying in the cupboard until I can get replacement castors. Surprisingly for Dyson, this is a design fault. Maybe they’ll come up with a serviceable solution in future models. … have just been advised by Dyson that they have no ETA for getting the castors back in stock but will advise me when they’re available."
338,1,"A souped up dust buster, just use a broomI bought this to clean cork floors at my house. It’s fine at getting small dust and little objects but with such a tiny throat and no clearance it cant handle even small items.
For the cost I would expect a lot more. If you are super clean already and prepared to pick everything up from the floor first then it may work for you. Im selling mine and will go back to a broom."
339,1,"Disappointing DysonI gave this one point as it manoeuvres well & gets into corners and edges easily. Poor suction as a stick even worse suction as a hand held. Too long to be comfortable & work well as a hand held. Doesn’t pick up everything & often spits small pieces of fluff back out. Sometimes the rollers stop working & then just start again. This is my third Dyson, I have loved my other Dysons but am so disappointed with this purchase."
340,1,"Dyson Gen5 disappointedWe purchased a new Gen5 after our Dyson v12 died.
So disappointed with it and want to return it. Such a backward step compared to older model.
Says a bigger battery life, totally not true we get at best 40mins.
When using the carpet head and you hit the skirting a terrible noise comes from the head like it's going to break.
Suction is not as good when using the smooth floor head, we have tiles and its pretty usless with pet hair and the light makes it worse.
Totally disappointed.
Dyson offer 45 days return but only if you purchase from Dyson so Good Guys said sorry can't help you..
Waste of time both Dyson and Good Guys."
341,1,Terrible machinePurchased June 2023 and had nothing but trouble. The machine kept telling me there was a blockage and would stop working. Rang and Dyson said it was the air filter and they would send replacement but found out 2 weeks later they were out of stock. Finally received new filter and all good for awhile but the same thing has happened again. I spent a lot of money for these problems and am not impressed.
342,1,"Not recommendedThis unit is not of good build quality. Three weeks into using it, the red frills around the top part was starting to fall apart. A week or so later, the wheel attached to the bottom of the stick broke off. Seems to be a common problem with this model. Contacted Dyson directly and they just palmed it off a cosmetic stuff… well, not if the unit is not even 2 months old. VERY DISAPPOINTED and would not recommend."
343,1,"The head broke after one use!Had I written this review last week it would be glowing, but unfortunately it's the second week of using it and I've already returned it because the wheel snapped off it. A quick internet search shows many others complaining of the same issue.
Sure, it vacuums really well... before it breaks. Thankfully the retailer was understanding, they had also had two customers with the same issue, so this isn't an isolated case. I was able to get my money back.
I had only used the carpet head once when the wheel broke off... that just isn't good enough from a vacuum with such a high price tag."
344,1,"Heavy, wheels fell off,It’s not easy to vacuum using this vacuum cleaner. Very heavy, doesn’t vacuum well even and wheels fell off after one week of using. Lucky we could take it back. Overall dissapointed. Dyson is overrated and overpriced. All they do well is pay off influencers and website for promoting their equipment."
345,1,"Lasted a few months. Don't buy. EverPurchased Gen 5 detect. The brush head died after 3 months. Returned under warranty to Jb Hi Fi, was sent for repairs. Took 6 weeks. Returned still broken. You have better options these days, take them."
346,1,"TerribleWould have to be the worst Dyson I’ve ever had the Dyson Detect Absolute, heavy and very cumbersome to manoeuvre around especially when using the hard floor tool. As for the detect tool, it doesn’t pick up a lot of the harder debris on the floor and only just manages to clean a light carpet and when you change the tool to the hard floor tool it’s even worse on carpets. Not happy at all, much prefer my older Dyson. Very hard on the wrist to manoeuvre around especially if you have arthritis!"
347,1,"AVOID if you have carpet or rugsYou will need to dig deep into youtube videos to find a unbiased review or sponsored video to find out what im talking about below. Listen to some of the other low star reviews here.
Overall, avoid or consider other options if you have rugs or carpet. Or consider using the money back gurantee if you purchase directly from Dyson website. Im personally keeping it due to the hardwood floor performance and power button. To save you some research, the V15 motor head does slow down on carpet and rugs, but it doesnt stop. So consider the v15 if the trigger isnt a problem to you.

The Bad:
If you have carpet or rugs around the house, you need to change the gates on the head to ""-"" setting to avoid the motor from stopping. If its in the middle or ""+"" the head will just stop. You also need to adjust the suction to Eco or Auto and hope it doesnt stop too. When it does stop you need to turn the vacuum on and off again.
Also if you try to push the vacuum along to avoid it from stopping, it makes a bad grinding noise. I believe it might be the roller bristles rubbing on the anti hair tangle vanes! i guess over time this will wear the bristles out so you need a new roller soon.
Also Dyson has designed it so you cant remove the dust bin filter(the metal grate). I believe a lot of dust will get clogged in here over time. At the moment im cleaning it out weelky with canned compressed air.

Since its a newer model, offical spare parts arent available yet. Everything is still for the v15 and lower models.

The Good:
On hard wood floors, I love it. The foam roller does all the heavy work. The suction sounds like its on low most of the time in Auto mode. Occasionally ramps to boost mode. The laser is great.
Also love the button power button which is why i purchased this over the v15 due to the trigger.

These are always on sale, so dont be too bumbed or feel rushed to buy one. I think they go on sale every 2nd month minumum!"
348,1,"Would get a better rating if the battery was any goodI bought the Dyson Gen 5 Absolute after seeing some good reviews and seeing a claimed battery running time of 70 mins. In ‘auto’ mode the battery goes flat after around 25 minutes of cleaning (70% tiles, 30% carpet) and drains significantly faster on carpet compared with tiles. It cleans well but that is not much use if the battery is flat. I would buy a second (outrageously priced) battery if one was available, because one battery simply isn’t enough. This vacuum has some nice features such as a tool inside the wand, but the dust bin is difficult to get completely empty and there does not appear to be any way to easily clean the filter and dust bin. Not impressed considering the purchase price."
349,1,"Doesn’t live up to the advertisingThe motorised head keeps stopping as soon as it touches certain surfaces like low pile rugs or carpet. Which makes it useless as those are the areas where a motorised head is required.
The run time is nowhere near 70 mins despite using the eco mode as suggested and despite the floors not being overly dirty. The boost mode, which is wonderful, last for a very short period.
Recently I started getting an error of ‘airways blockage’’. Making sure the filter was clean and no blockages in the bin and wand area, and trouble shooting using Dysons online help it hasn’t resolved the issue. It would work for a bit and then stop with a message saying airway blocked.

Big design flaw - if you wall mount the unit the detachable tools don’t fit on the mount at the same time. So you’ll need to store the other tools elsewhere.

Overall, for the price tag, I would avoid."
350,1,"Found an utility knife blade inside the filter(not the bin)It didn't affect the machine but it's really a safety hazard. I wa lucky to see it in the first place. The lady called from custom service on 14/09 was very harsh. Also apparently I am not supposed to know why there's a blade in my machine, because it's an 'internal investigation'."
351,1,"Doesn't work on carpetI upgraded from a V10 and expected it to work better.
Unfortunately if the carpet has any kind of pile the suction is too great and the motor head stops spinning. The vacuum has to be used in eco the whole time, which defeats the purpose of paying for such a powerful cleaner. If used on auto, it will eventually ramp up and stop spinning.

Most reviews don't mention this and you have to go hunting for this specific issue.

If you only have hard floors this vacuum is probably fine. But then you don't need as much suction on that type of flooring anyway. This product makes no sense."
352,1,DisappointingI was upgrading an older model Dyson for the latest model mainly because of the button start not a trigger. This is one of the only good features. The up to 70 minutes of run time is grossly exaggerated. On auto i am lucky to get 25 minutes. The fluffy head with the green light shows everything which you think is great but after vacuuming normally and you decide to go over it it still looks like you have lots of dust left. So you go over it again with not a lot of success. The dust bin doesn't show a lot in the canister so i have to wonder if this is a bit of a gimmick . Dyson is very glowing in their advertisements but in reality it doesnt perform very well. Far too expensive and doesn't live up to its reputation.
353,1,"Greatly overrated vacuum cleaner which is very poor value for moneyI was so looking forward to using the Gen 5 Dyson Cordless vacuum cleaner. I found this vacuum cleaner so very disappointing. I would not recommend this machine to anyone. It does not vacuum up animal hair at all from my carpet.
I even used the boost button which did not help at all."
354,1,"Unpleasant product and unpleasant customer serviceUpgrading from a V10 (without a soft roller head), I was hoping for easy pickup of cat litter and other smaller particles, a scratch-free clean on my new dark floorboards, greater ease-of-use (the laser light, having a power button instead of manual trigger, and 'Auto' mode) and a generally smoother, more polished user experience. Unfortunately most of this hasn't eventuated, and I've made the disappointing decision to return my new Gen5detect under Dyson's 45 day satisfaction guarantee, and to move on from Dysons altogether. [EDIT: Dyson responded by pointing out that the 45 day satisfaction guarantee only applies if you buy from their website, and not their ebay store, even though the invoice comes from the same company, implying that I can't return my machine. I found this belligerent and unnecessary, as there's a 30 day money back guarantee via ebay, so much of a muchness to me, except for the extra rude service on top - hence I've downgraded my rating to one star, as I don't find this acceptable at all.]
I had the V10 for several years. and while it had a few niggles, they weren't absolute dealbreakers and it was ok. When I installed new dark European oak engineered hardwood floors, however, the V10 motorhead was obviously scratching them (which is terrible, since it's supposed to be usable on soft and hard floors, but nonetheless it obviously was), so I decided after much internal debate to upgrade my machine rather than spend $150 on the soft roller head for the V10, prompted by finding the Gen5detect heavily on sale at Dyson's ebay store, despite it being a new/flagship model. Essentially it was an offer I couldn't refuse, especially as it comes with the new 'Fluffy Optic' head with laser light (fancy). I was looking forward to the new features and hassle-free vacuuming on all my surfaces (tiles and rugs in addition to the new floorboards).

Given this is the 'latest and greatest' Dyson (and after being a long-term Dyson user), I'm super disappointed that the Gen5detect comes with more issues than the V10 had and hasn't materialised as being the 'complete' vacuum that I'd hoped it would be.

Good points: The Gen5detect with the motorhead on is great on my long-pile Beni Ourain Moroccan rugs - I have to do multiple empties because it sucks up so much dust and fibres and it works fast (slightly but noticeably better than the V10, which was also very good on these rugs) - I imagine it would be similarly good on carpet, however we don't have any in our house. The fluffy optic head also does pick up the kitty litter that the motorhead just spits out and pushes around, so that's something. That, however, is about it, unfortunately.

Issues: While great on thick rugs, the motorhead doesn't work properly (ie. at all) on one of my short-pile rugs - it just gets stuck and stops turning, which is super annoying. There is a '+/-' adjustment on the motorhead, but even at the lowest setting and on 'Eco' mode (which in itself kind of defeats the purpose of having a Dyson, why does it exist?) it just won't function, so there's no way to vacuum this rug with the motor head. So am I supposed to use the Fluffy Optic head on this type of rug? It just feels wrong (and not powerful enough to suck up the pet hair and other fluff that accumulates in the pile). The V10 at least did all my rugs without issue.

Most disappointingly, the Fluffy Optic head is also scratching my new dark hardwood floors - with the laser light illuminating (to my horror) each scratch as it happens. I just can't fathom why, with all of Dyson's purported engineering expertise , they can't make the rollers and other hard points on their cleaner heads soft rubber, and/or put a layer of soft material around them?! Is it really that hard? Do they not test these things on all surfaces? To be fair scratching wasn't a concern for me before I installed my new flooring (it's not been a visible issue with tiles), but people have dark wood floors! It's not that unusual! Surely a $1k vacuum should be able to be relied upon not to scratch them?! I've just spent a lot of money and effort upgrading my floors and to have them scratched immediately is just heartbreaking, and intolerable, especially with the latest-gen, super-expensive vacuum cleaner running a 'soft' head. Raising this with Dyson I got a generic 'send it to our service centre and we'll have a look' and 'the head may be faulty, it shouldn't be doing that' response, but the head looks fine - in my opinion this is a design flaw and not a manufacturing fault, and I just can't be bothered with the whole sending it away process to find out something I already know. A quick google suggests that Dysons scratching dark floorboards is a common issue, and clearly it's not something they've bothered to rectify in this latest model.

Other annoyances: I find the laser light depressing. It really does highlight dust and other stains I had no idea were there (a bit like the blue light on CSI), but no matter how much I vacuum or mop, I don't think my floor is ever going to be perfectly clean, with two dogs and a cat, and using the Fluffy Optic head just illustrates this in a weirdly depressing way (as echoed by another reviewer, who also used this word) - I just feel defeated the more I use it. It's also thinner and 'clunkier' to use than the motor head, so you don't really feel like it's sucking, more like it's just running over the floor? Hard to describe, but it is what it is, and it's not 'nice' to use.

Also there's no option to choose your own suction level - when using either the motorhead or the fluffy optic head you can only choose between 'Eco', 'Auto' and 'Boost' modes. I thought 'Auto' would be a great improvement over the previous models' manual selection requirement (intuitive, you don't have to think about it), but I found it annoying that I couldn't just lock in the speed that I wanted (low/med/high like on the V10) and also that it was constantly changing pitch/suction level (from an auditory standpoint) - the constant up/down variance was just irritating while vacuuming, and the only way around it was to use 'Eco' mode (which really, I'm not sure why you'd bother with, as it seems less than 'Low', and you don't buy a Dyson to do mild suction, do you?) or 'Boost', which is unnecessary and super battery-draining.

So a mixed bag, but too many niggles for me to tolerate. I'm returning mine because the floor scratching is a dealbreaker, as is the non-ability to clean my low-pile rugs with the motorhead. I think if you have carpets and tiles this would be a fine machine for you, but if you're a timber floors and rugs household like us then I would suggest finding something else (I'm not sure what - it's back to the drawing board for me, with an absolutely non-scratching head being my utmost priority). Unfortunately after many years it's time for me to break up with Dyson and explore alternate vacuum brands. I must say the generic/scripted responses and lack of actual concern by Dyson's customer service team has also left me underwhelmed - they seem hell-bent on protecting their machine's reputation and not admitting fault rather than willing to accept that it just doesn't function properly in some circumstances due to its design, which is just extra frustrating when you're already a frustrated customer."
355,1,waste of moneyBrought Gen5Detect takes longer to vacuum . Soft head for wood or tile floors to small. Its depressing using this vacuum absolutely HATE this machine.
356,1,"really good till you have an issue then you are on your ownwe were really happy with the gen 5 until after around two months the digital display stopped working
Dyson said they would send an exchange replacement after 6 - 8 weeks of not hearing from them and then getting the run-around and a very much not interested attitude we were told to pack it all in a box and send to Sydney ( we live in Perth) would we ever see it again? how long would we have to wait not knowing these are serious questions i have, and before the Dyson rep happily tells us to contact there support hotline they are the problem"
357,1,"Awesome product until it wasn'tI purchased the Dyson Gen5detect vacuum on the 22 Dec 2022. I was keen to upgrade from an older model to take advantage of the extra battery life and motor suction. The machine worked flawlessly for two weeks and then the hard floor Motörhead stopped spinning. I lodged a support call on the 6 January and 8 weeks later I am still waiting on the replacement. This product is not cheap but I was prepared to pay extra for a quality product, which clearly I did not receive. Very disappointing from a company I admire. I have a trail of emails should Dyson wish to escalate resolution of this issue. And yes, I understand the Motörhead is out of stock but this is a company issue that shouldn't be thrown back at the customer."
358,1,"Just Don’t do DysonSo after being told by Dyson I couldn’t buy a part for my small ball vacuum (a small internal hose) and I had to have it repaired at a service centre I happened to come across the Dyson light ball on sale.
It arrived today and it didn’t even vacuum 2 square meters before the multi head stopped working properly. Tried it again and again yet kept stopping as the vacuum got pulled back towards your feet.
Even the cheapest of vacuums work for a little while - couldn’t get 5 minutes from a Dyson vacuum.
Never again"
359,1,AvoidQuite heavy to manoeuvre. When it's working it has good suction. The biggest issue is its gold star ability to get clogged. Then you need an engineering degree to clear it. Not user friendly.
360,1,Not so Light BallVery hard to manoeuvre on carpet. Using the hose extended is near impossible as it retracts like a consertina and it’s a struggle to keep it extended. Be prepared to have back pain after using this machine on carpet. How can they call it “Light Ball” when in fact it’s one of the heaviest most cumbersome vacuum cleaners on the market. It does have good pick up power but at a cost to your body. Only a fit strong person is recommended using this machine definitely not for everyone.
361,1,"I have to pull it apart every time I use itIt has really good suction.... for a few moments, but how many times must we pull it apart, ???...and so many plastic parts we must pull apart, to find the piece of dust that is blocking the whole suction system???
A lot of easily breakable plastic parts.
Every third or fourth time I push it, it blocks up I must sit on the floor which I am vacuuming and pull it apart for that elusive clump of dust WHICH BLOCKS UP THE WHOLE DAMN SYSTEM.. everything must be pulled apart again and again and again.
My son honestly believes he was doing me a favour by giving me this vacuum cleaner but it has caused me nothing but hard work and much frustration, pulling this damn thing apart every single time I use it....
Every single time!!!!!!!!!!!
I spend more time pulling this thing apart than what I do pushing.it around the house!
...Did I mention that I always have to pull it apart because it blocks up?
Out of sheer frustration, I pulled myself off the floor, away from performing surgery on my vacuum cleaner to write this review.
Now I'm going back to my surgery!"
362,1,"Doesnt work on carpetAfter assembling the vacuum (wasnt wrapped in trying to read pics and no words) first 15 seconds were amazing on carpet but the roller brush just stopped! Had to keep turning it on and off again every 10-15 seconds :( you cannot use it on carpet without the roller brush as it needs a lot of force to get it to budge. I had an earlier model dyson upright that you could use on carpet without the brushes which stopped the vaccum marks on carpet so was great. Do not like this later model at all and will be returning it. Hate that it collapses so easily when you grab the handle, was better when you had to step on a lock lever. Really disappointed that i wasn't told you cant use it on quality plush carpet. Also feel that the plastic is a lot thinner and not as durable. And the lead is short and you barely get a round a large room. Also tiny barrel so you have to empty it more frequently. Glad i bought it at Harvey Norman where they do refunds!"
363,1,Worst Vacuum Cleaner I have ever usedExtremely heavy and cumbersome. It took a lot of physical effort to push and pull on carpeted areas (despite brush roller button being activated as per instructions). The roller brushes deactivate often and on their own for no reason. When using the hose and wand the whole vacuum cleaner tips over even when it is stretched no more than 1/2 of its potential length. The head of the vacuum is so large that when the head is pushed up to vacuum against a wall there is not even enough suction to pick up a small piece of tissue that was against the wall. Certainly would not be able to use this vacuum underneath a bed as even with the hose and wand option there is no wide head to attach to it to use under a bed. Laid down the vacuum would not fit under a bed. I cannot fathom how Dyson prides itself on product design.
364,1,"Dyson light ballThe Dyson light ball when assembling the components felt like it was of poor quality plastic. I was wondering how many times the parts would click together before breaking. Well the vacuum lasted 14 days before the plastic handle broke off. It was only the second time I had used the vacuum.
Fortunately the Good Guys refunded my money wth no objections. One star Dyson, 5 stars Good Guys. The other interesting thing is when I returned the vacuum the price had dropped from $600 to $400."
365,1,"Doesn’t work on carpetWorks well on wooden floors but the head stops working when on carpet. I expected as a multi floor vacuum cleaner that it would work on all floor type but particularly carpet as that is what a vacuum cleaner is for. It is currently in being fix for the second time in less than a year. When fix Dyson gives no feedback on what was wrong with it, they just send an invoice with a list of parts used. I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner to anyone who has carpet or rugs"
366,1,"Planned obsolescenceAfter my parents owning a Dyson for over ten years with no dramas I thought I would get this vacuum for my small house. It has been working fine and I've always looked after it, including washing the filters, removing hair from the head, and emptying the dust container. However less than one month after their two year warranty ended the rotating brush on the head of the vacuum magically stopped working...something electronic I would assume, and I was offered no way to fix it by the company. The timing is too convenient and frankly I'm disgusted that companies continue to manufacture products with the sole purpose of breaking after a year or two. Dyson and all the other companies that do this can go to hell. F*%K Planned obsolescence!"
367,1,"Very disappointed!Having owned a Dyson upright vacuum for 10 years and being very pleased with it. It was time we finally retired it and purchased a Dyson Light Ball Multi Floor Vacuum - UP16 online from Big W , which we received this morning.
Excitedly we trialed on our hard floors. It worked as well as expected. However when it was used on our carpet upstairs the disappointment soon set in. The rotating head on the front moved no more than a few meters before it stopped spinning. Reset after reset did not help and it became obvious there is a serious design flaw with this vacuum. The bracket around the rotating head draws down completely on the carpet and it is impossible to move the vacuum without a huge amount of pressure.
Dyson were contacted and they were hopeless. Giving us a scripted response of absolute rubbish.
We are still trying to contact Big W but at this stage their phone system is a poor as the vacuum cleaner we’ve bought from them.
Very bad all round experience. Under Aust consumer law it must be repaired replaced or reimbursed for the cost. I don’t really want anything other than a properly working vacuum. Poor effort Dyson!
I will update if any progress is made.
Paul"
368,1,"No Customer SupportGood Vacuum, however, after 18 months of light use the machine started to smell like burn plastic, as sent it to get it repaired under warranty and after 1 week waiting they txted me saying they don't have replacement parts in the country and they will take at least 2 weeks to arrive so it will be over a month to fix, I called their customer service and they advised me to ask a friend for a vacuum or buy a new one,, what a joke"
369,1,Not what I expected save your moneyI had a Dyson for about 12 years I loved it bought the new lightball I hate it the cord is very low down I hate the extender for the attachments I have so much trouble getting it back into place the old one was brilliant. The barrel needs emptying much more as its very small I wish I had really tried it out at the shop I would not have purchased it only plus is it has good suction. It has nowhere to put the attachments the old one had spaces on the vacuum so I have to go find them it leaves deep ridges on the carpet when wheeling when finished its extremely hard to move around when done not as stable as the older one save your money dont buy one
370,1,Will not operate on semi plush carpetJust received a Dyson Light Ball Multi Floor from Dyson Online. As soon as we start the cleaner the rotating head/brushes stop. On hard floors no problem but on semi plush carpet absolutely useless. Rang Dyson Sydney who said their vacuums don't work on semi plush carpet. No mention of that when you order one. 45 day money back from Dyson Australia.
371,1,"So disappointedTwenty years ago I purchased a Dyson upright vacuum cleaner - DC04 and during that time I was always impressed by its excellent build quality and outstanding performance. It was only when a small concertina hose at the base of the cleaner split and could not be replaced due to the unavailability of parts, I needed to purchase a replacement. From my past experience with the DC04 and my Dyson V7, I had no hesitation in choosing another Dyson upright. I decided on the Light Ball Multi Floor. What a terrible mistake!
1. The build quality has certainly been cheapen off in comparison to the DC04.
2. The capacity of the canister is extremely small.
I used to empty the canisters on the DC04 at the completion of vacuuming the whole house but this machine requires emptying after every room.
3. When you wish to push the machine using its back wheels from room to room, it is extremely unstable.
4. Although the cleaner has ample suchion, as you move the vacuum over the carpet the 2 revolving hemispheres, which are suppose to assist with ease of movement, leave tracks all over carpet. I spoke to Dyson about this and they did not know how to correct this from happening.
5.The hinge and clip mechanism on the lid of the canister are moving parts, which you would expect to be fairly sturdy but from my observations, they appear extremely poor quality.
I was so looking forward to using my new Dyson uprigjt cleaner but that has not been the case. Kerrie"
372,1,"too heavythis is terribly heavy to use and stiff to maneuver cord is short and stiff as well, has caused injury to shoulder, arm and back. the suction is too strong"
373,1,"NOT HAPPY JANI have been using Dyson vacs both barrel & stick & would always recommend so when I wanted to upgrade I thought the upright would suit me as I’m getting older. I am so disappointed in the upright model I find it hard to maneuver, for me it is heavy & both my wrist & shoulders hurt when I use it. I get caught up in the cord & do not like the hose as all I do is drag the vac around when I try to use it. I really thought this would be a great choice & I did check out the reviews but I’m sorry I bought it but of course I can’t return so I’m stuck with it as I gave my old barrel vac to my daughter - she’s happy but I’m not."
374,1,"Cheap and painful to useBought many dysons, this one the worst. They have dropped their standards as the plastic is cheap and flimsy, the handle does not fit back into the hose easily and the maneuverability of the ball is stiff and requires much effort from your wrist to turn it. I do not recommend this vacuum."
375,1,"part two of my dyson outsize absoluteback for repairs as explained in part 1 except I don't use it in customers' homes after installation of tv points as the Dyson reply said !! it is not for fine dust and debris they said Now I have lost the $13000 cleaner for 15 weeks all up and have lost my faith in this middle !! they said I didn't empty the waste bill enough !! Now this Is a guy who purchased 2 extra batteries and 4 extra filters at over $450 !! So Dyson it is emptied after every use
And the batteries are rotated !! So I should get it returned today they say! Not happy with this expensive toy to date! Other than that I hate excuses and blame !! It got blocked with dust and I live and it was sold in the dusty town or port hedland !!Its a vacuum cleaner !!!"
376,1,Expectation exceeds its ability ! Dyson size absolute extraI have alway wanted a Dyson stick vacuum as at customers houses i have cleaned my dust and wall debris !as i install Tv antennas and satellite dishes ! So i finally purchased a $1300 Dyson ! It worked well for 14 days then the trigger faulted ! But if i have to press it 5 or more times to turn it on so be it ! Then i found it alway flat and required 6 hours to charge it ! So i purchased two new battery's at $400 to my amazement they went flat too so realising that once they’re charged and you turn the PowerPoint off the charger discharges the batteries to empty .This I thought was a waste of power and time ! And not good for the battery then of course once I charged it and use the Dyson the heat coming out of it was hotter than my cordless battery drill under full load . I took it to the shop and hopefully replaced or fixed. I’m not sure one other thing I thought was silly that the $1300 Dyson vacuum cleaner only comes with one filter. I have purchased four extra filters and will write another review once I get it back from the shop and give it a bit more of a try. First impression I absolutely loved it. At the moment. I’m not sure? little bit disappointed but faults do happen. Ultimately I’ll see how good their customer service is !!
377,1,"Absolute Lemon!I bought the Dyson Outsize complete direct from Dyson in August 2022.
It initially worked well on our hard floors and carpet.
It has progressively got worse, it no longer spins the brushes and it doesn’t suck.
I spoke to Dyson at the end of January to troubleshoot the issue and we came to the conclusion that the body of the machine was faulty and needed replacing.

The lady who was most helpful said that the replacement body was out of stock and it would be available in a couple of weeks.
It has now gone past that window, I have no working vacuum cleaner, and they’re “trying to source an alternative” but only when I chase it up.

I have spent $1500 on a machine that was meant to be reliable, it was meant to last a long time and it’s now dead, useless and i don’t have a replacement!"
378,1,Battery too expensiveThe replacement battery price has jumped from $80 to $125 in the last year. Too expensive for something that lasts 2-3 years.
379,1,This is rubbish. Dont buy. 3 batteries in 4 yearsBattery dies too frequently for infrequent use product. 3 batteries in 4 years. Don't recommend. Rubbish.

381,1,Useless- only lasts five minutes fully chargedI can't even clean a small car without the battery running out. It lasts only five minutes on full charge. The suction isn't great either. I wasted of my money here.
382,1,Children’s toyBrought it to vacuum car. Totally useless has no suction and battery runs flat before I can finish vacuuming the car. This vacuum cleaner is only good for very small jobs.
383,1,"Pretty but UselessNew out the box, fully charged (about 5h) only lasted for 5 minutes 44 seconds. Repeated twice with the same effect.
When the surface too close to the nozle it chokes and suction action stops"
384,1,"Absolute rubbish, not worth the cost or effort""Right, that's it!"" we thought. After struggling for almost six months while our ecovacs deebot 920 POS randomly decides it can only go backwards in circles, and ecovacs refuse to repair it under warranty (despite it being just 18 months old and Australian consumer laws requiring it), we decided to replace it with a real robot vacuum.
We like Dyson - we have a number of their products - so decided to give their new robot vacuum a try, particularly since they have a 90 day returns policy on the unit. We know that it doesn't have a mopping feature but actually I prefer to use a bucket and mop to be honest.

The first thing that struck me on unboxing the unit was how heavy it was. At about 5kg it is almost one and a half times the weight of our ecovac dumbot. The design is different to most modern robot vacuums, being a D shape, having one long rotating brush along the front edge and no side spinning pickup brushes, and an automatic retractable suction side duct.

Another significant difference from many other vacuums is that Dyson appear to have chosen to use an upward facing camera and other sensors/cameras (26 in all) for mapping and navigating instead of the more common laser.

Once the unit was charging in the dock (which has two black and white square orientation markers), I paired it with the MyDyson app on my phone. Using Bluetooth, this process took mere seconds, unlike the much more painful process with the ecovac.

Once paired, I could immediately examine the features of the app and robot. Most of the usual features are there - scheduling and viewing cleaning history, settings, help and the like. Now fully charged, the first thing to be done was to map the house. Our house is a fairly typical Australian single storey 4x2 with activity and theatre, with mainly hard floors (laminate or tile), about 220m2.

Usually I have found that mapping is done during the first clean but the Dyson has a special vacuum-less mapping mode. Selecting this mode I expected the robot to finish in half the time but no. Bizarrely it took the most random, illogical route for mapping the house, going all over the place, and it took almost two hours, the same time it would take the ecovacs in vacuum mode! It also left an annoying trail of dust bunnies around with it, gathered from under the beds.

Eventually it finished, although it missed one room because the door had been shut the first time it entered the hallway. Annoyingly it refused to recognise the room existed from that point on, even though it went past the open door many times. I have yet to work out how to add that room now, I don't want to have to create a new map! I can't even tell it to go to that area manually and map the room, because everything is based on the mapped areas - catch 22.

Once the map was created, it was time to ""zone"" the rooms and label each of them. At least the ecovac app would make an attempt at identifying the various rooms, doorways and etc., but not Dyson. Each and every area or room had to be individually defined and set up and since the map has no zoom feature, this is a frustrating operation. The room labelling was equally annoying, the short list of options only allowed for a few standard names, unique names are required and stupidly all the custom rooms have the same icon. More annoyingly, if you need to adjust a zone, and re-label, it wipes all your labels and you have to redo the lot!

We only have a couple of no-go areas in the house, mainly areas where there are cables which would traditionally get caught up. The bot seemed to navigate all these without difficulty so fortunately it was not necessary to set up no-go zones or no-climb or no-brush zones.

However, it is clear that the Dyson app developers forgot to actually look at any other robot vacuums apps before they created their own. Not that I'm suggesting they should directly copy other apps but they could have at least got a few ideas of what to do and not to do. The map screens really do need significant work - as a software developer myself, I would not have let this feature go out to the public, it is alpha quality at best, little more than a proof of concept.

The bot has four cleaning modes, any of which can be selected via the LCD panel on the top of the bot or from within the app. Using the app enables the user to select both the mode and the zone(s) to be cleaned. The four modes are:

Auto: The vacuum will automatically adjust its suction power based on the amount of dust it detects.

Quick: For quick, everyday cleans.

Boost: Maximum suction power for a deeper clean.

Quiet: Quiet cleaning.

For my first test I decided to send it to the laundry (using auto mode), where there was a good scattering of cat litter and pieces of dry cat food around where the cat bowl would normally be, by the door to the back garden.

Interestingly it cleaned the centre of the room first, making short work of the pieces of debris it found, it then took a strange route closer to the edges, then finally it deployed its side suction nozzle to clean right to the edge. This worked quite well to even remove some of the debris from under the front of both the washer and dryer.

However, much to my surprise, it failed to go all the way to the far end of the room by the sliding door, where all the bits of cat food were, so it completely failed to clean that area. Upon the bot returning to to dock at the end of the task, I immediately sent it back to laundry but this time in boost mode. Again, it took the same route - centre, then close to the edges, then actual edge and again it ignored the far end of the room.

I assumed that this was as a result of poor mapping, however I looked on the map and it clearly showed the end of the room correctly and showed the bot stopping short both times, for no apparent reason. Perhaps the answer is that it simply doesn't like going near full height windows and doors. If this is the case it is even worse, given that most of the windows and doors in the house are full height - not cleaning up to them is a downright failure.

The next issue we discovered was that because the bot is 93mm high at the edges (99mm at the camera maximum), it couldn't clean to the kickboards in the kitchen because it couldn't get under the cupboard doors (80mm). Even using its side suction nozzle it was unable to get to all the debris.

The third test was to send it into the gym (activity) to clean the carpet which was, at this time, still covered in dust bunnies from the mapping task. The problem we found this time was one of battery life. The gym is carpeted to reduce the sound of the equipment in use but is also the route to the cat flap so gets quite dirty with hair from our cats.

The gym being carpeted and with a significant amount of dirt and hair on it, the bot had to use the increased suction which it turned on and off as it went around the room. It had significant problems navigating around the various equipment and, frankly, made a rubbish job of clearing away the dust bunnies and cat hair. Due to the D shape, this unit ought to be able to get into a lot of awkward spots and clean right into the various nooks and crannies. Unfortunately it failed miserably.

The other problem with the gym was the battery usage. By repeatedly using the boost power, yes it made a very good job of cleaning the areas it actually went across, the problem is that it it didn't make a very good job of actually covering the entire carpet. Unfortunately, this meant that it had to stop part way through the cleaning and return to the dock to recharge, despite appearing to have half a charge before it started.

Perhaps if Dyson had used a laser to more accurately map the objects in the room it could have made a much better job of cleaning close to legs of the equipment but I found it left a significant number of corners and similar locations that it failed to clean well at all. The same applied to chair and table legs - I expected to see the unit do the circuit around the table legs, instead it simply made a very poor attempt at coming at it from a number of different angles with the side nozzle deployed and making a very poor job of it.

Based on my observations of the amount of battery used to clean the five rugs or carpeted areas in our house, it will be unable to perform a full Auto clean of the house without two recharges, which is ridiculous. These are just the observations from the first day!

The next morning I got a notification on my phone telling me it would start a scheduled clear in about two minutes, this would be five minutes early. I checked the schedule, it was correct, so the unit was saying it would start early. I reset the schedule by another half hour - same result. However, it actually started right on time - so the notification is incorrect which suggests poor testing of the app.

Navigation is another area where this robot has serious failings. When told to do a general (quiet) clean, instead of cleaning room by room, it appeared to divide the area into quadrants which it then overlay onto the map - this leads to, in my opinion, a very inefficient route for cleaning the rooms. To be honest it made a pig's ear of the first clean, leaving bits behind and failing to clean very well at all. Full length curtains were also a sore point for it. I had lifted all of these off the ground during the mapping but during the clean it made no effort at all to try to go under them, unlike our previous bots which would approach slowly and try (successfully) to push through.

After one hour of ""quiet"" cleaning it had made a very below average job of poorly cleaning the two main rooms, not even including the main bedroom ensuite. I then sent it clean the dining room and it made an average job of that, successfully navigating around the table and chair legs, but still not making a particularly great job of it, no better than our previous units.

Finally, I sent it back to the laundry to see if it could do that right on a third attempt. Amazingly it did finally manage to to get all the way to the far end of the laundry. Unfortunately it still failed to clean all the pieces of cat food. Although the D shape allowed it to drive straight into the corner and it deployed the side nozzle it still failed entirely to clean the corner at all. If the side nozzle came out at both front corners it might have a chance or getting these pieces but the side brush less design actually works against it in these scenarios.

At the end of all this the battery was almost empty, despite it having only (poorly) cleaned about half the area that the ecovac would have completely (and better) cleaned in the same amount of time.

There are a number of features in this robot that are really great.

The ability for it to detect the amount of dust it collects and create a ""heat"" map which it can then use to bias how it clears is brilliant. This means that it biases its cleaning to the areas that need it. Not having a bunch of consumables like side brushes and filters to replace all the time is another benefit, the filter and brush bar are both user washable. The shape and side duct are great for cleaning long straight walls. The powerful suction and Dyson vacuum technology means that it does make a great job of cleaning carpets. The app has one great feature - by having a specific mapping feature, the thing does not keep updating the map as it cleans, my biggest bug-bear with the ecovacs app.

However, the excessive height means that the unit cannot get under as low furniture as the advertising suggests. Most other units have a lower profile, even including the laser pod, which enables them to get to much lower spaces. In addition the wonderfully powerful cleaning power makes the battery life honestly pathetic, unless it is only ever used on hard floor. The D shape could have been a real bonus but the navigation software makes a mockery of it and the position of the single side nozzle fails to take full advantage of it.

In conclusion, therefore, we have already decided after just two days of frustration and disappointment that we will make use of the 90 day refund policy that buying this unit direct from Dyson gives us. At $2399, I feel we can do much better with another brand.

Nice try Dyson but I can't give you more than ""3/10, must try harder (much, much harder)"".

p.s. To be fair to Dyson, we bought the unit direct from them (at a service centre) and they honoured their 90 day satisfaction guarantee and refunded us the full price without question."

390,1,"Terrible product and customer serviceI bought it . With in 4 month its on/off button stop working. I went to Goodguys from where I bought it. At first instance customer service there started blaming me that this fault is due to my improper cleaning and care. They send it to repair in same city where I was investigated and blamed again for fault. I was asked , how many vacume I have at my home. How many time I use it. How much area I clean with it.
They kept on blaming again and again that I was not cleaning it properly. I was titled of giving clarification. After four weeks argues they return it saying that it was just matter of proper cleaning and change of a small rubber valve which was jammed due to dust and they showed me how to clean though I know very well already.
Soon after few days the same problem again, button not working.
Now it was clear that problem was inside vacume not just outside cleaning. Now repairer again tried to fix it but it was not fixable and they have to give new one after a lot of arguments and time consuming.
I will never buy a y product from this company. They just say warranty. But very hard to get warranty cover."
391,1,"Terrible Vacuum, Terrible Suction, Broken Twice within 1 Year & Terrible Customer ServiceThis vacuum is one of the worst I have ever used. The suction is terrible in comparison to my old Miele and with in the 1 year the handle and telescope part of the vacuum snapped. I was able to get the spare part sent under warranty and it then snapped again with in 3 months. This time when I called I was bounced around to multiple people and told even though it was under warranty I would need to take it to a repairer and then inspected and a report written as to whether I could get a replacement or store credit. When I called the repairer they said it may be customer induced in which case they couldn’t do anything unless I paid $65 for a thorough inspection and repair and I should call back Electrolux customer support if not happy. I’m only a little person but I do vacuum everyday. How is it possible that the same part could literally snap twice within 14 months of purchasing. I’m sick to death of the crap quality and time wasting of trying to get my money back or items replaced. Whatever happened to consumer rights?!
I advise you to steer clear of this vacuum and perhaps Electrolux all together as they are unlikely to support you!"

Returned to repairer under warranty Replaced motor that visit
Motor died 2nd time I used it
Very disappointed with product and convenience of repairer
Wont be buying Electrolux again"
394,1,"Just 3 months out of guarantee and it diedBought from the Good Guy's Robina, and was initially really pleased with this vacuum, good suction and easy to use, but it periodically overheated despite making sure filters etc were clean. Now just over 2 months out of its guarantee it died. Do electrical items have some kind of circuitry in them so they know to break just out of guarantee? Very annoyed."
395,1,"WORST VACUMN IVE EVER OWNED! WASTE OF $440!I bought this vac after reading reviews on here saying it was 'the best' vac for pet hair. I get it home and within the first week, the machine stopped sucking as strongly as it was upon first use, barely picking anything up. I took it back and was given a replacement machine. The next machine I got never sucked as well as the first from the get go, but then it started sucking at the same level, whether set on high or low. Then it started gathering all the dust etc in the top part of the machine and not filtering it down into the barrel, (see attached photo) which caused the machine to overheat and stop. So again, it went back. And with Harvey Norman Product Care, I only got back the replacement value, which is now far cheaper than when I bought it, so now I'm over $100 out and still have no working vac! Will never purchase an Electrolux product again."
396,1,"Lasted 2 monthsBought this vacuum cleaner
2 months ago from Bing Lee and it suddenly stopped working. Filters etc clean, no blockage. No I’ll be wasting time replacing. Not happy."
397,1,"Good Machine Cheaply MadeIt's a good machine built to last for the warranty period only. Bought this last August from Harvey Norman and the handle already disintegrated from the joint one year and a month later. The power cable retraction mechanism is hit and miss as well. Works sometimes.
I loved the Electrolux Ultraone I had before this but after this purchase looks like I will have to move away from Electrolux Vacuums."
398,1,"Poor quality, Low suctionI purchased this vacuum only to find when I opened the box a bent hose and the turbo head would not sit flat at all was very stiff and when I tried to vacuum and I had to keep stepping on it every few seconds to get it to stay down to vacuum it was a loosing battle. Then the hose would totally bend on the bent section of the hose and stop suction. So I returned and got a replacement I could have got a refund but thought it could have been a one off. I was only to find the turbo head is still staying up on the new 2nd vacuum and I'm having to stand on it every 5 to 10 seconds to keep it down and suck, not as stiff as the first head but still wanting to stay up like there's not enough suction to pull it down and the plastic join is just stiff. They said it would loosen up with use. But shouldn't a product work straight away from purchase not wait to see if it loosens up. I'm only persisting with this vacuum as the head is the only one that glides easily (when it stays flat) over triexta carpet. I believe the recycled plastic has compromised the quality and it's way over priced at $599. If the head dosent loosen up after the next few vacuums then I'll be returning it again for a full refund. It's suction at full is only half that of my Miele that I have given to my daughter due to the heads would not glide over my carpet with ease. My recommendation is don't buy this product.
Update 22/09/20: tried to vacuum with it again and it's was a missing battle, hubby the builder had a go and after 30 seconds said return it. The head, plastic hose is so stiff it just makes the job impossible. The vacuum is not cleaning the carpet as the head won't stay flat. I returned to Godfreys Bathurst and got a full refund. This product is made from 60% recycled plastic and it has made a poor quality product. Electrolux discontinue this product please I've had two and both are unusable what are the odds of that."
399,1,"Avoid - Disposal vacuum cleanerRarely used this vacuum cleaner and surprise suprise, after the 24 month warranty period it conveniently doesn't turn on. It's pretty noisy. Be prepared to throw it in the trash after warranty. Support claims there's probably too much dust in the filters and to drop it off at a service centre for repairs. Not buying anything electrolux in future"
400,1,"The joint between brush head & tube crack in less than 6 mthsOverall it is a good vacuum that do its job for both hard floor and carpet.
The wire is very long and the vacuum is light to carry around.

Just surprise that the quality of the parts are so bad that it crack in less than 6 mths.

The wheel is also very bad as I struggle to move it around instead of following me smoothly like the Nilfisk I own previously.

Got a replacement parts after contacting the Warranty department. The replacement arrived within a few days which is fast based on current COVID situation.
The component seem to be a bad design when I compare with my older vacuum which lack of that extra click which I believe will break again soon.

It broke again as per the 2 new pictures."
401,1,Terrible Product. Don't buy !There isn't anything silent about this vacuum except in the name. Nozzle jumps like a frog when cleaning and broke exactly after warranty expired. Cant even replace nozzle as it is discontinued and I just have to throw the vacuum away. Worst ever vacuum.
402,1,"Terrible - (And dont buy from Godfreys)This machine only worked properly for the first few times. It seemed to clog easily - manually having to clean out each of the many cylinders each time. Then it stopped working. (It seemed to overheat like a hairdryer). Because of the pandemic, Godfreys wouldn't fix, exchange, refund. I had to buy a new machine and now I'm stuck. Save your money"
403,1,"NOT silent. Sucks good, until it breaks down. Warranty is FAKEI do not know why they call this silent, it's actually as loud as any other vacuum cleaner. It does suck well. However, motor breaks down at 10 months. Warranty claim was refused. Said it was due to poor maintenance of filters. They expect you to clear the filter after each use or else warranty is void. Basically, they could use this clause on anything. They could even refuse your claim if the motor breaks down on the very first use."
404,1,Worst product I have ever purchased!Worst product I have ever purchased and Electrolux customer care was woeful! Good guys reused to replace it and made me call Electrolux myself to try and get resolution which was a waste of time too. They absolutely didn't care at all.... Be warned and don't buy Electrolux anything!
405,1,"This is nowhere near silentMy admin person bought this about 2 years ago after I said I wanted a quiet vacuum cleaner at work. Unfortunately, it was neither quiet nor a very good vacuum cleaner. To be fair, she was not to know this based on what this machine was said to do.
It was always too loud for me. I could hear it being used through my treatment room door at work. I used to have an Electrolux UltraSilencer and could never hear that through the door- so I will go back to that one. But my admin person liked using the SilentPerformer and she was the one doing the cleaning so I didn't really worry too much. However, now it's just me at work and I'm back to doing the cleaning (!) and this is a very noisy machine, moreso when you use the powerhead. So I use the all-floors head instead. The clean isn't as good, but at least I still have my hearing when I've finished vacuuming.

This is used on carpet and linoleum and tiles. There is probably a fair matter of dust that is walked in by my patients but this machine should be able to deal with that. It used to do a better job cleaning 2 years ago and it only gets used 2-3 times a week on average for maybe 10-15 minutes each time. The suction is getting worse. It doesn't matter if you clean the filters. This machine does NOT last the test of time. It is past the warranty date so I can't do anything about that. I just don't think it's made well. Perhaps being used in a less dusty environment may have suited the machine better?

The extension piece on the wand now gets stuck and is almost impossible to click into place after I finally manage to get it to extend. I am not 4ft tall and I don't want to bend terribly to vacuum! It even has some trouble unclipping at the head unit when I take it off to get into corners. And the back of the head struggles to glide into place on the side of the machine when you put it away now. It used to be absolutely fine to handle - but in just 2 years the ease of use has gone from good to bad.

It's very easy to unclip the dust catcher...but it makes a mess when you empty it. I really do prefer bags. It also overheats. And the cord is not long enough - and pops out of powerpoints at the slightest tug. I really am struggling to find anything good about this machine! Basically, it is NOT anywhere near silent. Noisy, in fact. I have to say, I think they lied about that one (not that I have a sound level meter to check...) but it's always been quite noisy. Now, 2 years on, it just feels like a hunk of junk.

I think a vacuum cleaner should last better than this. And I don't think it should have the word 'silent' anywhere in its name. The only way it's anywhere near vaguely 'quiet' is if you don't use the powerhead and you've got it on very low suction. And then it doesn't vacuum properly anyway! So really, there's no point to this machine. For the price, I've used far better and far quieter vacuum cleaners."
406,1,Best invest in a expensive vacuumHad this vacuum for only a week & already it overheats and stops working for long periods. On top of that it doesn’t clean my carpet as good as my old one (German).
407,1,"Started off greatStarted off as a great unit, I think I have had it a year now and suction is not what it was...I got this after a Hoover I had at 14 months old had the filter come off and block the suction. I am starting to think this is doing the same. How can I get a good vacuum that isn't going to cost me an arm and leg and work for more than a year or two...!"
408,1,"Neither Quiet nor Good PerformerShops urge consumers to post reviews immediately after buying. This is idiotic and I guarantee 90% of the reviews here have been posted within the first month of acquisition. They do this in order to push as many units through the door as possible by people reading 'positive' reviews of goods which have been owned for usually a matter of days.
I have had this vacuum cleaner now for 18 months. It is not particularly quiet; pretty much average as per noise levels. The worst thing about it is that the performance gets steadily worse over the months till when you get to this stage the suction is about nil. The design is poor: the release switch for wand extension has to be pushed up toward the body instead of the more natural movement of down toward the head. It overheats if you try to pick up anything larger than a couple of centimetres and you must allow it to cool down overnight. So basically it does not do what it says it does on both of these selling points.

I would not recommend buying this vacuum cleaner unless you want your life to become an endless cycle of buying a new vacuum cleaner every 18 months."
409,1,"Not too silent for price to payNot too silent for price to pay, this Vac was really good performer till the warranty went on, Literally one day after the warranty finished harvey norman did not want to respond us. First thing they told when we called was to ask us how we have cleaned machine, they asked us to bring machine to store , upon bringing the machine to store. Store always found something wrong with how we have maintained the machine but never bothered to helps us professionally clean the machine. Machine is still the same noisy, low on the suction and unable to perform."
410,1,"Extremely Hard to use this Cleaner on cut pile 100% Nylon CarpetSuction is great. While not a Silent-Performer as Electrolux purports, it is significantly quieter than the noisy Dyson we used to have. The cleaner is VERY hard to push over a 100% cut pile nylon carpet, so that if you're considering buying one for this purpose, then I suggest you chose another brand. Nylon carpet is subject to shading, where the surface appears to be of different shades. The cleaner leaves to track marks over the carpet from the 4 roller wheels on the head, making the inherent shading more noticeable.
Their is no crevice tool provided & the dual-purpose accessory brush/small head provided is next to useless.

When the hose is turned around to change direction of cleaning, it tends to knock the speed controller into the ""off"" position, which is annoying.

In summary. I am very disappointed with the cleaner, and therefore can't recommend."
411,1,"Waste of moneyThis model must have been designed by someone who has never vacuumed. Great to use if you've already done a thorough sweep and mop of your floors. Continually gets blocked by anything larger than a lentil. I find the cord too short, not very easy to manoeuvre and it's cumbersome to pack away. Vacuuming is already a chore and using this cleaner makes it thoroughly unbearable. One star for being made from recycled plastic."
412,1,I'd heard about the on switch problemsI was expecting great stuff after ordering this model. My mother who was a fanatical dutch cleaner who over the years always swore by the electrolux brand. Unfortunately my brand new model won't even switch on. Sooo disappointed .... even more so after talking with the customer help line. They directed me to look for a turn on button on the hose handle. I felt like a fool when i could not find a turn on button on the hose handle but was relieved that another witness also could not see this suggested button as there is not one!
413,1,2nd use shutdownWe bought this due to its size not so clunky as our old one and we trusted the Electrolux brand name. But for 2nd time after 30mins or so of 'normal' house vacuuming when I switch off to move rooms...it won't switch on again! hopeless. Thought due to overheating? But I have 2 floors to clean. I don't have time to let the thing cool down and for $300+ ---I shouldn't have to.
414,1,"Didn't last long !This was purchased as a replacement for a dead vac. It is quite a neat tidy design that does not topple over or turn upside down when towing it around, as many do (Dyson et al)
First comment is that it is nearly impossible to pick it up- there is a handle on top that does not seem to move and traps the knuckles or snaps one's finger nail if you try to use it. I am pretty good with mechanical items but I cannot find how to fold it up.

Second- after the first whizz round the house the brush had a lot of hair ravelled round it and had become wuite stiff to turn. The second use I ran over a Kirby grip (Bobby pin) Suddenly the turbine in the head sounded like a chainsaw. I wanted to remove the brush to clean it but found that it is held by 6 security scews, 2 of which are hidden under the wheels. Then the moulding has to be prised apart with a knife. Just the thing for the busy house person !

The turbine is a weedy little item with single-ended blades. The Kirby grip had snapped one blade off so now the whole head vibrates badly.

The persons that design these things obviously have no idea how they are used in real life. A Kirby grip !What would a 4-spot piece of Lego done to this turbine? Total carnage that's what. This was really the second time it was switched on and used, and I don't have a hope of a warranty return- ""Oh, maam, you should check the floor before you vacuum.

Bring back the Hoover Junior."
415,1,"DisappointedBought a Electrolux vacuum cleaner many years ago and was brilliant. This latest one I can not bag enough. If you don't clean all three filters just about everytime you use it, it has the sucking power of a straw. Sent it back because power button wouldn't work which was fixed. Don't waste your money buy a cheap one from Kmart it will do same job. It is that pathetic I will never buy an Electrolux product again."
416,1,"Worked well for 2 weeks, now uselessElectrolux silent Performer
Seemed good for the first few weeks, then lost most of the suction. Had to pay $60 for new filter , worked okay again for a few weeks, now back to useless. Only a few months old, and not cheap. Expected better. Would not recommend at all."
417,1,"TerribleI have had the indigo and the chilli red , both are terrible . I have just purchased a shark detect pro and it is the best vacuum I have owned"
418,1,"Worked fine for 4 months and then went kaput!I got this from the Good Guys and it worked well for just a few months. Like the other reviews mentioned, the suction stopped working and the unit would turn off on its own randomly. Cleaned the filters, roller etc but it made no difference. Dirt would also fall out of it when you turned it off. The light on the swivel head also stopped working. Pretty pathetic - cost over $300 and only lasts 4 months. Surely this is not right?"
419,1,"Wish I had paid attention to the reviewsI bought this vacuum in May this year. I had the previous model which was still going and needed another stick vacuum. Well, as others have said, all good for 6 months then it stopped a couple of times. I wondered if I had touched the button. But now, a month later, it just stops all the time and is not suctioning. Cleaned everything inside it but that is not the problem. When it stops dirt falls out the foot. Have to turn it on 3 times just to vacuum the ensuite. So taking it back to the good guys. Stay tuned.
Do not bother buying this vacuum! Obviously has a manufacturer fault since others have the same problem."
420,1,"Do not buy this productFull changed battery won’t lasting as specified. They say on low power, battery lasts 50 minutes but it doesn’t.
Low power = zero suction power
Brush doesn’t cut stuck hair/fibre on brush as per specifications but it stops picking stuff the floors, especially carpet area
Very bad product from this brand"
421,1,"id give this zero if i could. do not waste your moneyit would turn off after a few minutes use right from then start. i had it ""repaired"" under warranty within a few months with no difference even though the guy said that it now worked. despite cleaning the hose, cannister, filters.. it makes no difference. it does not even have suction. good guys and electrolux were of no assistance what so ever. a total waste of money. it has been sitting there unused for a year since i got it back pulled it out today to do a quick clean and it does not work."
422,1,"Would not recommend this machine. Do not buy it. No battery replacementRecently bought the machine in Dec 2022. Unfortunately, I was told by the girl at Electrolux centre today that there is no replacement for the battery after the 2 years warranty. I spent $349 on a machine that will only last 2 years. Very expensive to me. Would not recommend this machine to anyone if no battery replacement as it will be useless . Very disappointed."
423,1,"Thought I was getting a good deal!Simply went shopping to buy a replacement for my faithful ErgoRapido stick vacuum, which was still working after many years, but had lost the screw holding the handle together. I was impressed by the stronger suction of the next model up - Pure Well Q7. First time I used it, it kept switching itself off every couple of minutes. Thinking it was something that I was doing wrong, I persevered. Next time I used it I tried vacuuming up some uncooked rice that I had spilled on the kitchen tiles. I noticed that it stopped suctioning after picking up a bit of the rice. Decided to empty the canister - no rice at all in it. The rice had not got past the hose leading to the canister. Pulled it apart and managed to clear the rice from the hose and although the suction returned, the machine kept on turning itself off every few minutes. I decided to return it and go back to my original choice of ErgoRapido and I couldn't be happier. If this one lasts as long as my previous ErgoRapido I will be a very happy person. I have also found that the ErgoRapido is much easier to empty and clean than the Pure Well Q7."
424,1,"Didn't last not even the 12mth warranty periodI use it my car mats, the car boot, the plastic surface under the car mats and to clean the tiled area.
Now there's no suction, it also turns off. Just as I was beginning to like it. I was even thinking of buying one for the tiled area in the house lucky I didn't.
My cheap house vaccum cleaner which I bought for 59 dollars has lasted for 5 years and the Electrolux which is supposed to be a good brand cost more and didn't last 12months."
425,1,"Not fit for purposeWorked okay for 12 months, but then started cutting out every half a minute, leaves junk everywhere when you switch it off, suction got lower and lower as the months went on and cleaning the canister didn't help that, now it doesn't work at all. Absolute piece of rubbish. Can't believe they want 600 bucks for this turkey now. I'm glad I didn't pay the 500 they wanted at the time"
426,1,"Worst vacuum cleanerI bought this vacuum cleaner in March this year thinking it’s the higher model of the last one we had so should be better! Biggest mistake thinking that! Basically from day one it’s been an issue vacuuming, keeps stopping after a minute of vacuuming! First we thought it needs emptying, cleaning or hair is stuck or a combination of all these things together! Tried everything possible to get it not to keep stopping but nothing helps! Spent 3 months getting frustrated and thanks to the lockdown not being able to return it sooner! Now when I took it back to the good guys they’ve said I just have warranty to fix it!!! I don’t want to be stuck with this vacuum cleaner! I should have the choice of what I want to do with it! Now because of this I have to wait at least 2 weeks to get it fixed! How ridiculous! So first I get a shot product then I have yo wait to get it fixed and be without a vacuum cleaner as well!!! I don’t recommend this vacuum cleaner to anyone unless you want add frustration in your life! You buy a stick vacuum cleaner to make life easier and quicker not frustrating and take forever to get your houses cleaned because of the amount of time you spending cleaning the damn vacuum cleaner to get it to work! Just really not happy with it! Electrolux when you make products make them so they are not faulty and stand by them rather than forcing your customers to keep the damn thing in g if they are so unhappy with it!!!"
427,1,"Dead after 9 months of usePurchased this a year ago. Was pretty good for a month and then stopped picking up hair and dirt. It now stops working after 5 minutes. I contacted Electrolux and they suggested it should be left for three hours due to over heating. Sadly there is no replacement warranty. We have been told to drop it off with a service agent, which will mean we have no vacuum for an unknown length of time. I will not be purchasing another Electrolux as a replacement. Best to avoid this vacuum."
428,1,"Do not buyI bought this from Appliances online and the powerhead continues to stop working and jam. The other head does not work effectively on carpet, it is useless. Suction isn’t great at all. It’s just an awful machine. Electrolux were meant to send me out a replacement head but have not done so and it’s been months. Will never ever buy this brand again. Over $200 and it’s a lemon. Customer service also tends to reflect quality, or lack of, vacuum"
429,1,"DisappointingWas a great machine for 2 years. Light, easy to use, good suction. Suddenly it started overheating and switching off. Cleaned filters, but still no good. Won't be getting another. Retrieved my 21 yo Meile from the garage."
430,1,"Poor quality productThe vacuum cleaner has good suction but overheats after a short time and you have to wait a least half an hour for it to cool down. I have wooden floors and a couple of rugs with no pile so not working it very hard. This is without the dust collector filling up. Have tried washing all the filters. This is the second machine. The motor on the first one burnt out while still under warranty.
I have an Electrolux from the 1970's which still works, but it's heavy and scratches the floor dragging it around. They sure have gone downhill."
431,1,2 vacuums just stopped working in under 12 monthsThe first one I purchased on 18/9/20. Worked great until 30/10/20 (just over a month!) when it just stopped mid vacuum and would not start again. Took it back to the Good Guys who after some consultation replaced the vacuum for exact same model on 31/10/21. Today (23/10/21) the replacement did the same thing - stopped mid vacuum and would not start again. So I am back to the Good Guys for a replacement only this time won't be going for the same model - 3 new vacuums in 12 months is a bit much I think Electrolux!
432,1,"Absolute rubbish, I am gobsmacked it gets good reviews!!After our previous electrolux vac cleaner accessories started falling apart just out of warranty, I swore I wouldn't buy another electrolux vacuum. We were looking to spend sub 200 and this cleaner came up at 190 on Good Guys commercial, and for god knows what reason averaged over 4 stars, maybe these people were using a dustpan and broom before?. I started off at nearly 3 stars but by the time I finished vacuuming the house I settled on 1 star. Firstly the Pros: Really good suction, reasonably quiet and very light. Now the Cons: The biggest reason for the rating is the accessories, or more so how they connect to the vacuum, even on our previous Electrolux, the hose and accessories ""clicked"" together, on this vac they just push in, nothing to hold them there other than the tight fit. 2 issues with this, firstly over time with repeated pushing in and out the connections will become loose, no doubt this will happen out of warranty period . Second issue is it is a pain in the butt everytime you want to change the heads (eg from turbo to hard floor) you have to pull the head out of the hose and push the new head in, this wouldn't be an issue if you never use the different heads or the other accessories but when you are changing from carpet to hard floor 2 or 3 times during a clean, it's a pain. Also at least once the combination hard/soft floor head came out because I hadn't pushed it in hard enough. So that's not my opinion, if you have different floors and want to use eg the upholstery brush, it's going to be more difficult than a vac with click on accessories, even our previous electrolux, which was cheaper, had click on accessories and hose fittings (the hose fitting into the vac is click in type, ironically this is the one fitting you never need to change, what the ???????
The ""turbo"" head sounds impressive but if you put your hand under it the suction is almost non existent, I was suspect when it glided over the carpet with almost no resistance, it is useless.
So on to the thing that just annoyed me: every time you vacuum up a small hard item, the ""cyclone"" gimmick causes it to whizz around making a noise akin to the local red cross volunteer rattling the change tin. Although the dust catcher was nearly empty, I had to empty it twice to avoid going insane. I now regret taking notice of the reviews and am returning it to the Good Guys. (of course, they wouldn't take it back, no worries, hello Harvey Norman)
UPDATE 1/1/2021 : At no time did Electrolux try to contact me to talk about or resolve my issue. I gave them 2 weeks to respond prior to publishing this review and I got nothing from them, so the Vacuum cleaner is lousy and so is their customer care !!

UPDATE: I just purchased a Miele C2 compact for 299 from Harvey Norman, so only 50-60 more than the Electrolux. It is like night and day!! The Miele hoses, accessories etc all ""click"" into place, it's quiet, amazing suction and doesn't fall over every 2 minutes . Do not waste your hard earned cash on the electrolux, for the love of god!!"
433,1,"Don't botherThis vacuum cleaner is not very good. It has a turbo head that lacks enough power to turn it properly to clean carpets etc. Also despite being only a few weeks old, our vacuum also started cutting out after a couple of minutes use. The filters etc were clean but it would cut out and not work until it had sat there for a while. Electrolux were not helpful and wanted us to take it to a repair place way over the other side of the city for evaluation."
434,1,"Not happyI use this vacuum on polish floor , carpets and tiles . Sucking and cleaning is acceptable but is very annoying when attachments and pipe comes off on time in use . Vacuum price low and quality also low ."
435,1,"Don't waste your moneyI bought this vacuum 6 weeks ago, at first the suction was great, but now, it wouldn't suck the cream off your coffee. I have spent countless hours cleaning every filter and orifice and still no suction. Paid over 200.00 for what I thought was a good brand but now, I feel it was a waste of money. I have 5 cats and 1 dog and vacuum daily and this cleaner is/was a total waste of money. Very frustrating."
436,1,"Works great until it doesn'tWe bought this vacuum 6 months ago because I accidentally broke our Dyson big ball and it was all that was in stock locally. I imagine it being the perfect vacuum for someone with a lower budget who has no children, lives in a small tiled unit, and is almost never home. However it falls woefully short for our family of 5 (plus ragdoll cat), where 4 are home full-time, 3 are intent on leaving a path of destruction in their wake, and the cat's fluffy hair apparently needs a litre of bin space all to itself. We also have a lot of carpet so possibly our vacuum demands are greater, but it's just something I've never had to think about.
At first I was impressed by the suction, although the poor quality of the attachments was immediately apparent. The whole thing just felt flimsy compared to what I'm used to but wasn't complaining at first because it was so inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for. It was all downhill from there though and within a month it had almost completely lost suction and the only way to return it was to wash the filter which was not straightforward. I also very quickly realised how tiny the dust bin is as I can't make it past the living area without having to empty it, and the dust bin itself is extremely difficult to empty if anything larger than a 10 cent piece has made its way into the bin as everything gets stuck between the filter and the wall. I have to manually scrape everything out of it by hand about 90% of the time which is not super hygenic. I've tried to make it work because I don't want to be wasteful but I am at my wit's end and am going to be ordering a Dyson cinetic big ball to replace it."
437,1,"Don't buy it!From the first day it has little suction, doesn't even pick up hairs, doesn't pick up anything from carpet.Tiny holder needs emptying every 5 minutes. Wash filters, makes no difference. Waste of money."
438,1,"Don't buy this productNo suction, does not work on hard or carpet floor and no way is it going to pick up dog fur.
In the first few months, I hard to contact the service agents 8 times and even when I sent photos of a part that had broken down, they continually sent the wrong replacement part. I now have 8 parts that are wrong and even though I finally got the right part, after 6 months ( just out of warranty), it has failed again.
After spending nearly $300, I now have to start looking for something else."
439,1,"Don't waste your timePlease don't waste your time and money. Initially seemed to work well, then the power head stopped working. HN were great and replaced with a new vac. Now, 5 months later, its just an exercise in frustration. It does collect dust and fur, as I can find some in the canister, but can't pick up anything like a grain of rice/bit of mud as it's too heavy. Minimal suction at best. Also should mention the strip of foam behind the brush head, simply means you only can use the vac when pushing forward, when you pull the vac back towards you it gets stuck behind the foam strip"
440,1,"High maintenance vacuumPurchased just on 6 months ago. With an older home and minimal power points I liked the idea of not having to drag a cord. I find if I don't clean the filters and clear head it just won't suck, however I am doing this so often than I would ever do on any other vacuum I have owned. Still, suction is not great. Its not as if I have a dirty home and using on anything excessive either. Its such high maintenance! Over $500 worth of waste. I have gone back to using my $40.00 budget vacuum for my own sanity. I wish I had googled reviews before purchasing."
441,1,"Doesn’t even suck up loose hairsIt is nice and light, user friendly. This is what lured me to purchase it as it was half the price of the Dyson with the same power. Biggest regret I ever had. It barely sucks anything on short rugs and carpets. Doesn’t even pick up loose hairs and simple loose dirt. I find it so hard to believe how poor the suction is. It’s ok for tile floor but even this has difficulty in sucking the easiest of loose dirt. This is the worst purchase I have ever made and DO NOT recommend this to anybody. You’re better off with a broom. In this day of technology I can’t understand how this is so poor. Disgusted by this product and will never buy Electrolux again from this experience. Imagine buying a Bentley that has no engine and only works if you release the hand brake and roll downhill."
442,1,Extremely disappointedWe liked the idea of purchasing a stick vacuum given our small home. No cords and ease of use were appealing. The first three months were fine then the rapid deterioration in function set in ie suction reduced and frequent cutting out due to overheating. Now needing to get a service technician whilst the warranty is still active. This is a high maintenance cleaner in terms of cleaning it’s filters and emptying the contents. We generally rate Electrolux products highly but not this one.
443,1,"it sucks, because it doesn't!no suction, not on wooden floors, not on tiles, forget the carpet!! only looks good and easy with navigation. I cannot understand how vacuum cleaner can be sold without its main function"
444,1,"Expected more for the priceI bought the Q9 to replace another Electrolux that I was very happy with. The Pure was purely disappointing. No suction, loud and expensive for what I’ve experienced. I’m going Dyson next, will pay more to get more. Ceramic tile surface, should be an easy surface to vacuum, but was pure work for this cleaner."
445,1,"Do not buyThe filter is difficult to clean and the rollers always get clogged. To top it off, only had it for 3 months and the motor blew up. No longer works. Don't waste your money."
446,1,"What happened to ElectroluxElectrolux used to be such a solid brand, my old vacuum cleaner lasted and was TONS better than this, I got the Electrolux Pure Q9 with the Animal head attachment, which seemed to work at first (although my place was not dirty to be honest, it is brand new and tiled floor so couldn't be easier to clean) however the Electrolux Pure Q9's first troubles started to show when it couldn't even pick up dust / fluff off carpet.
Couldn't clean dust out of my computer, I noticed the suction was just terrible and all filters were clean (it was almost new)

Shortly after this it wouldn't even hold dirt, it would fall out after a vacuum clean when I put it onto the charger (which is completely crap in itself and sometimes falls off onto the floor)

Harvey Norman is selling this for $750! The Kmart $69 Cordless Stick vacuum performs better in reviews and in Choices tests.

What makes it worse is Electrolux demanded I get it repaired and not give me a refund for almost a new product, thankfully Harvey Norman was great when I told them about consumer law, agreed with me and told them my point and gave me a refund.

I'll stay clear of Electrolux in the future with this customer service.

By the way I called Electrolux at first like Harvey Norman advised me to as they have this ""Platinum Service line"" which after 10 days of sending them photos etc via email like they wanted me to across the phone they still haven't replied."
447,1,"A pet vacuum that fails to pick up all but the tiniest amount of dust and hair - awful!This is a warranty replacement from Harvey Norman for a Bosch (the Bosch being amazingly good when working). Suction is appalling and constantly fails to pick up even the smallest pieces of dirt of the floor...most of the time it just goes over leaving it in situ, or flicks it forward for another attempt. Will not pick up small pieces of paper etc. and has been an absolute disappointment and a waste of money. Do not touch with. A barge pole...unless you are only going to be cleaning dust. Shame on you Harvey Norman for selling this."
448,1,"Electrolux Robot Vacs not upto standardAlmost Useless! Gets stuck, falls off the step, get stuck on simple things the other vac does not."
449,1,"Bissell Crosswave pet professional 2223HUsed once. Not suitable for hardwood floors. It has ruined my sydney red gum floors!!! and left permant scatches and marks/lines on it that are very noticeable. I just want to cry... Corded model awkward and heavy. The $450 for this product has now cast me thousands to fix my floors.
COMPLETE RUBBISH DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
These are my scratched floors after using this product."
450,1,"Big mistake buying this productBig mistake buying this product, I rather buy a cheap vacuum cleaner from Kmart or an expensive trustworthy brand like dyson. These mid range vaccum cleaners are just not worth your money. I bought a Bissel upright vaccum cleaner, the roller just keep rotating and there is no way to stop it on floors that get scratched from roller. The suction is no good for rugs, it just sucks and chew the rug into the roller head. And on tiles the roller head sucks dirt and rubbish from front, and keep blowing everything out from sides and back of the roller head. The belt that turns the roller in the roller head keeps coming off, between every use I have to pull apart parts and put the belt on Its just not fit for any purpose, highly disappointed with this product and customer service. The customer service will get you to do all sort of things to have you fix the issue, which is a manufacturing problem."
451,1,"Works well but rubber belt breaks easilyI bought this based on reviews in Choice and price as I wanted a turbo head for new carpet. At first I loved it as it cleans really well, and I like seeing the fluff picked up in the inner tube. I also liked that i didn’t have to buy replacement bags. However it is not easy to empty and refit. But the thing that has really disappointed me is how easily the rubber belt breaks. It came with two spares and all three have broken now, after only half a dozen vaccuums. It only has to be slightly too full, or to pick up the thread on the end of a rug for it too struggle, which leads to smell of burning rubber, smoke, and a broken belt. A fire risk too I imagine and the bands require unscrewing 5 screws and a strong arm to replace. Now I have to source new belts. The whole thing is light weight which I thought was great but that is because it is made of very cheap plastic. I don’t recommend."
452,1,"This vacume nearly caused a house fire , one month of using it and the bearings locked up & burnt !Carpet and vinyl ..this product is terrible and shouldn't be sold if it burns out straight away"
453,1,"good suction, poor quality, poor parts availabilityUsed on low pile carpets, mats and tiles. Expect it to fail after about 1 year. Belts melt, smoke and stink, roller brush locks in place. Unable to find replacement parts from various sites in Australia, including from Bissell. The model, while still available, seems unknown to parts sellers. Was good while it lasted, but did not last long."
454,1,"Terrible. I hate itSuction is good. And that's the only good news.
Terrible smell of burning rubber when used on anything except a really flat carpet or floor (hence the 2 spare belts, I assume)

Suction tube blocks up so very little gets through to the canister.

Cord wrapping for storage is cumbersome.

Drops/spits out most of what it picks up, a few inches further on. I'm going back to a Dyson!"
455,1,"Disappointing!Very disappointed in the performance.
The machine is very, very heavy and I couldn't imagine doing a whole house as my arm was tired after one rug and whilst the rugs came up clean they were dripping wet and over 9 hours for them to fully dry was a bit of a pain, not to mention that my rugs are now like wood; they are stiff as boards and I am hoping that they relax so that they don't need to be replaced.
Also, the clean water container is tiny and I had to fill it twice for one rug and then when it runs out there is no warning alarm.
Bit of a waste of $900 unfortunately."
456,1,"Was great then became garbage - twiceLast year, I had this vacuum cleaner replace another Bissell that they no longer stocked which needed to be replaced under warranty. I was very excited getting a completely new fancy machine. Wrong! In April this year it stopped operating properly. Sucked up nothing and spat out anything I tried to vacuum. I finally realised the hose where the bend is at the base of the head had split and therefore there was no suction after that point. Bissell replaced the part and they were very good about doing it- I will give them that; their customer service was fantastic. But mind you it was still under warranty. Well come October it’s done it again. It’s split in the exact same spot on the hose. I am just a 1 person household. I have pets but I don’t vacuum up shards of glass or knives each day. I have no idea how the hose keeps splitting but it’s in the most stupid area to have a bend and it makes it a hunk of junk when it happens because now I’m expected to pay $70 for a head that will have a split hose again in any number of months. Avoid this one."
457,1,"Bissell cannot replace broken hand vacuum on their Pet Hair Eraser model 2907FThe tab which hold the dirt tank to the hand vacuum broke off. Unfortunately Bissell are unable to replace the major part of the machine according to the overseas call centre for Bissell.. I have attached a photo of the broken tab (circled) on your product information booklet which came with the machine.
Also trying to contact Bissell by email or phone is exasperating."
458,1,"Bissell JunkI bought one of these a few years ago. It lasted only as long as the warranty and failed so I binned it. Compounding my error of choice, I bought another. It has lasted less than 2 years and now will not extract water from carpets and rugs. Bissell refuses to honour the warranty as we cannot locate the original receipt from Godfreys and as they are now bankrupt and closing, there is no chance of assistance there. I do have the Logistics packing slip with date and place of purchase but that is unacceptable to Bissell. Two out of 2 failures and I shall not contemplate another Bissell product given the failures and lack of support. Bissell products in my experience have been an expensive learning experience and I would never recommend the brand to anyone. This particular appliance is destined for the Chinese landfill aka council dump. Bunnings, here I come to buy another brand."
459,1,"Needs replacing already…As with other Bissell machines I’ve owned, our Crosswave Pet started making strange sounds only 8 months after purchase.
Took it back to The Good Guys who said the Bissell rep will look at it in the next few days. After a week and no call, I rang only to be told the rep was on holidays. The manager called me back later that day to advise the machine would be replaced. Unfortunately however, they had none in stock but I was assured stock would be arriving within a week.
Another week goes by without a word so I call again. Still no stock. Call Bissell customer service who appear to be overseas. Pretty useless. Told they won’t be getting stock until mid-May.
So now I’ve been a month without being able to use my machine and not sure when one will arrive.
I wonder how long it will be before the replacement machine needs replacing?
For the price they charge, these machines should go the distance, but every one I’ve ever owned dies in less than 3 years. Pretty appalling really."
460,1,"I was starting to love itI used my Crosswave twice, on hard floors. It was brilliant! until it wasn't.
On it's second outing, out of nowhere, it stopped working, tripping the fuse for the house.
I'd overlook this as an anomaly if a replacement had worked properly; but I don't have a replacement - Customer Service has been APPALLING.

I have been told to find (purchase) a box and packing materials sturdy enough to protect this large heavy machine in transit, lug it to the PO, wait 3-4 weeks for a replacement machine. To do this isn't that easy, and I'm not impressed. My bad for buying online, I guess.

But I don't see why Bissell can't adopt the Returns model of other companies : option to 'buy' a replacement which is delivered and the faulty machine collected; money is refunded if original machine is indeed found to be faulty.

C'mon, Bissell - help your customers feel the love!"
461,1,Poor suction - don’t waste your timeI have a large corded Bissell and it’s worth its weight in gold. I got this battery powered unit for quickly cleaning small stains as kids and carpeted dining rooms don’t mix. The suction on this thing is terrible. The carpet was left soaking wet and the stain remained. It struggles to pick up a fraction of the water you spray down. Perhaps it’s my cheap renters carpet and it may work better on a thicker pile but I returned it for a refund and will purchase a smaller corded unit instead.
462,1,"Bissel don't want to honour their warrantyWe bought this vacuum and it was good on our carpet, until the belt broke, this within the warranty period. We ordered a new belt from Bissel and put the new belt on, however the vacuum still didn't work, the rotating brush on the bottom wasn't rotating. We took the vacuum back to where we bought it and they sent it to Bissell for repair. Nearly 6 weeks later we are still without a vacuum cleaner and Bissell are arguing saying it needs a new belt - which has already been replaced by us, which I can prove. Now they want video from the store showing it not working, which they're not happy about. Our next stop will be ACCC ."
463,1,"Useless on hard floorsCheaply made. Very loud, especially on hard floors. Works fairly well on carpet but absolute trash on hard floors. The brush is continuous and therefore flicks everything away when using on hard floors rather than sucking it up. The cord is shorter than I've had on a vacuum cleaner. I bought it for $199 about 6-8 months ago. It is currently $149. Honestly, still not worth it unless you ONLY have carpet and can't find better quality. I suspect this will last a year, maybe 2, before it either falls apart or dies. Would NOT recommend. A previous Bissell - about $300 in 2015 - was MUCH better in every way. This one is a huge disappointment."
464,1,"Ordinary. Won't buy againI have always used Shark uprights and loved them. When my last Shark died, I asked around and was told Bissell was the way to go. Wrong! It's bulky, heavy, difficult to manoeuvre and I actually find the design really flawed. Yes the brush is powerful, but the piece of plastic in the middle means that you have to swipe several times in the same spot to collect everything. I also find the power brush needs cleaning out way too often as the dirt and hair collects in the sides and starts dumping everything back out on the floor. After about 18 months of persisting with this vacuum, im going back to Shark!"
465,1,"Worst piece of garbage I've ever boughtThis vacuum is garbage. Literally. It does not suck up anything off hard wood floors or tile and barely works on carpet. The handheld pet attachment also doesn't work and why on earth wouldn't they keep a storage peg on the vacuum itself?! Every other attachment has one except that one.
The carpet roller on the main unit certainly moves with ferocity but all it does is kick up loads of dust which you can see floating around as you vacuum. And as for any pet hair? Sure, it doesn't get caught in the roller, because the suction doesn't work, so the roller just turns it into a clump and when you lift the vacuum, it spits out wads of dirt, fur and debris. It has been like this since day one. I have tried taking the whole thing apart, have cleaned out every nook and cranny. This thing is completely useless. How is this even allowed to be on the market? I tried contacting the retailer and supplier, was given a run around, which I can't handle. I'm so sick of complaints over garbage products not being managed properly. Do not buy this utter piece of trash."
466,1,Had nothing but problemsClogs up very easily only had it 12 months using it in a 2 bedroom unit so not a lot of ground to cover. Recently it stopped working so I looked for blockages and nothing. Cleaned filters still not working. Called the place I purchased to get a new filter in case that was the issue they dont sell it had to go to bissell no luck there either none in stock til January 25th what am I supposed to do while I am waiting for the part I am not spending more money for a new vacuum. I would definitely be going elsewhere once I send the vacuum off to be looked at.
467,1,"You get what you pay forI bought this Vacuum 2 years ago. It does have good suction as long as you replace the filter weekly. It's annoying to take apart. It's always a struggle to empty the vacuum into the bin. You can't just open the bottom you need to pull the whole thing apart to get hair and other components out (fluff balls) anyway fast forward to yesterday. It blew up. Yes. It blew up in my face with a big puff of blue fire and it blew the safety switch on our house. Even turned the fridge off.
I feel like I could have died if the saftey switch didn't do its thing.

You get what you pay for. I wouldn't purchase this brand again."
468,1,"Broken product and company refuses to assist !Brought a bissell vaccuum less then 6 months ago ! Product is faulty, when contacted where we purchased from they told us they won’t do anything and to buy a new one !!!
Then after contacting bissell themselves they tel you they will assist but don’t do anything about it ! Now I have been weeks without a vacccuum as I have been waiting for A response !
Don’t do it !
Find a brand that is trustworthy and actually appreciates their customers !"
469,1,"Beware of any Bissell product!My CrossWave stopped working after only 8 months. Something has gone wrong with the motor. I tried contacting Bissell support by completing their online form twice and after three weeks I haven't heard a peep from anyone. So today I called their support phone number and it was answered by someone offshore who told me it needs to be taken to the ONLY service centre in all of NSW which is 400km away from me in Port Macquarie!!
I've since tried calling this service centre and no one answers!

Bissell clearly have no regard for any concept of after sales service when this is the only option available to you. It's just abysmal. Never again will I spend $800 on a Bissell product when there's almost no way to make a warranty claim. The warranty may as well be written on the back of a napkin."
470,1,Hopeless purchase avoidPurchased this and the booklet enclosed said it came with 2 brushes but only 1 enclosed. Also can only clean tiled floors at the moment as no stock anywhere at Bissell or Harvey Norman of rug brush and solution or wood floor solution. I was really keen to clean rugs with this but guess not. Tried to ring Bissell sat on hold for half and hour and have up. Wish I could return this. Useless for my purpose
471,1,"Worse resultNot recommend it. Very disappointed with result, battery, self-cleaning and most importantly it make your floor worse! Dont know how quality control accept this product to be sold to the Australians !!!"
472,1,"Waste of moneyBought this product with high expectations due to the positive reviews, however I was very disappointed with its performance. By the time I had manoeuvred the machine backwards and forwards to get coverage of my tiles and then again to vacuum up the water I could've mopped the floor in far less time. I've also purchased their floor cleaning solutions which I cannot return, so out of pocket with those products also.
The additional roller was not included but it was supposed to be posted to me....still waiting!
Very disappointed that it didn't meet my expectations. I posted it back today which cost $41.15 so again, out of pocket.
I'm also very disappointed with their customer service via email and phone. It appears that no-one cares once a purchase has been made but I challenge this company to prove me wrong. I look forward to receiving a refund."
473,1,"Useless waste of moneyCould not possibly be more disappointed. This vacuum does not have mapping and vacuums in a random pattern missing huge sections. The app stopped working and was a waste of space and missing features like ""find me"" manual steering and pattern choices. The vacuum often gets stuck and the battery lasts about 20 minutes. It often has trouble finding its way back to the charging station. Does not pick up very well at all and floats straight over the top of crumbs without picking them up. Tried to return with Bissells 60 day return policy but customer service just stuffed around until the 60 days expired and then refused the return because the 60 days had elapsed. Not happy BISSELL"
474,1,No goodBattery life way too short. Great looking machine but good for maybe one family room.
475,1,"Like the product, dislike the companyThe Vacuum itself was great but it had a manufacturing issue about a month after we purchased it and have been chasing a warranty ever since. It's a shame because the product we really like!"
476,1,Not that goodGreat suction when it's not blocked. I've spent a lot of time trying to unblock the hose. Now the hose on the head needs replacing which means a new head. I like the light on the motor head but the handle is very heavy with the motor head attachment. Good for very shaggy carpet. Tips over from time to time. Overall I would not recommend.
477,1,"Terrible Crosswave and No Support from BissellI bought my Bissell Crosswave Max Turbo in May 2023 and till Oct 2023, i.e only 5 months, I used it only 3-4 times and didn't turned on 5th time. Looks like battery is dead and wont charge as there are no lights coming up on the mop while it is on charge. Bad thing is bissell support is very bad contacted them a few times and left enquires on their website support section but no response from them. I spent 750$ and not even a year this machine got faulty. I wish bissell replace it for me."
478,1,"DisappointingFortunately I used my flybuys points to purchase this as I’d be returning it if I had purchased this from a retailer.
It’s very heavy, and hurts my arm to use it. The rotating scrubbing brush barely touches the carpet so I have to push down really hard simply to get some scrub action on my stain. And due to the weight and the need to push down so hard it’s painful on my forearm. The clean water tank requires a ratio of about 3:1 water to carpet clean solution. And since it quite easily utilises a full tank on one spot, ur using a significant volume of solution. The bottle of bissel solution will be gone by the time I’ve done another couple stains. It’s probably good for 4 stains/spots.
And considering the price of the bissel solution it’s not at all economical.
The suction is minimal, my carpets are left very wet afterwards.
I was hoping this would be easier/more practical than my cheap vax carpet shampooer, but due to the fact you only get 20mins of powered cleaning, and the scrubbing brush barely touching the carpet, I managed to do 1 or 2 spots before I had to recharge. I recharged, leaving the clean tank refilled ready to go. Next day I went to do the other couple marks only the find the clean water tank had leaked, even tho I had the machine correctly positioned upright so as to avoid leaking (the instructions state that it leaks if on its side or if you clean a sofa in a downward motion) turns out it leaks upright too.
One positive I can attribute to this appliance is how easy it is to clean the machine itself. No screws to remove the scrubbing brush, it just pops out which I really like. M
Other than that, I’ll probably continue to use my vax even tho it’s heavy and big, and a huge pain due to its size, it cleans almost as well as a professional carpet cleaning machine. And it takes 2 seconds to clean a stain- the bissel takes much longer and does a sub-sufficient job aswell."
479,1,"Replacement battery costs more than the vacI'm sooo angry, my dad passed away and I have inherited his bosch athlete vac so it has sentimental value, it only vacs for around 3 minutes so I rang Bosch to enquire about a replacement, well, it's built in so that will cost you between $400 and $500 dollars the eude lady said..how can they justify this..bet they don't tell customers when they are buying this vac that the battery will cost more than the vac...disgusting."
480,1,"Buyer beware. Don't bother buyingRubbish, please don't bother buying this product. Doesn't hold charge for very long. Replacement batteries are mire expensive than the unit itself. Bosch are not what they used to be. Will not buy another Bisch product again."
481,1,"Joke of a machine and so is the customer serviceuseless product
useless customer service
KIE-RAN from customer service in NZ is super unhelpful and so is BOSCH. I thought it was Bosch so must be good only to be told they don't have parts for my vacuum after 2.5 years. cant supply parts to general public.
They want me to send my machine into their service center to replace a battery ffs. I can do it but no I have to pay someone from their service team to do it as they are Bosch appliances trained. I hope they have Bosch appliance trained employees sitting in china too where they get manufactured. what an absolute joke.
machine in the BIN. I am surprised they are able to run business in such manner where everyone wants to be eco friendly but these companies making it so hard for people to get them repaired. so Glad my main Vacuum Sebo has been great. never missed a beat and these pile of junk after spending so much money cant even last the distance even when used minute or 2 a day and never charged unless battery was drained.
Time to buy a manual sweeper to replace the stick"
482,1,"Battery lIfe POORI have owned this vacuum for three years now. In almost every respect this is a well designed product. Nevertheless, the lithium batteries have started to die. I was quite happy to replace them but found out that this is next to impossible which means an otherwise perfect appliance needs to go to landfill!!
I amoungst many others detest this needless waste. BOSCH makes quality products, so I am disappointed that they don't stand behind the products they sell. I tried to ring them but found their Australian number had benn disconnected?? I think this shows contempt for their customers, so I will never purchase a Bosch product again."
483,1,"Don’t buy this junkI’ve had 2 Bosch Athlet Stick vacuums and both batteries have failed to charge just out of warranty and the batteries are not user replaceable, I would never recommend this product, in fact I am dubious about recommending any Bosch product after continuous problems with other Bosch appliances, Bosch was a reliable product many years ago however these days the quality has taken a dive and now it’s temporary trash like most other brands."
484,1,Battery lasted only 4 years !The battery will last only one minute of vacuuming after charging - for a vacuum that is only 4 years old. There is no way the user can change over the battery - it's fully sealed in.
485,1,"1.5 year old appliance, battery massively declinedSame issue as everyone else on this thread. Vacuum cannot be run in turbo mode without the machine switching off after a couple of minutes. It runs on the lower settings which no longer provide enough suction to clean carpet properly. Should have stayed with Dyson! At nearly $400 this was a bad buy and clearly a dud product."
486,1,Don't buy oneWe have owned this for less than two years. The suction is MAGIC and I was so impressed with it I raved when I first bought it. Now... Battery dies even on the lower settings within minutes. I'm extremely upset with this product and I've read the battery is irreplaceable unless you spend hundreds of $$ on it. NOT WORTH THE SPEND don't go there I wish I hadn't
487,1,"Non-Replaceable Battery - Bosch Quote Over $500!I purchased this vacuum in early 2019 from Harvey Norman. Over the years the battery has degraded to the point of only lasting a few mins (or a number of seconds on the highest suction). I contacted Bosch who informed me that the battery is not user replaceable and the cost for them to service it would be over $500! That's more than I paid for the vacuum in the first place, totally unreasonable. The customer service representative in spare parts said ""it's cheaper for you to buy a new one""
Bosch are selling products with batteries that they know degrade (as all batteries do over time) and telling customers it is ""infeasible"" to repair at their exorbitant costs, directing consumers to instead purchase a new unit (after only 4 years or less of use). This is simply unacceptable, repairs should be available for key components at a reasonable cost and for a reasonable period of time.

The vacuum also does not work when plugged in whatsoever, so you can't even use it corded as a backup for when the battery dies. For a product to be a throw away item due to only 1 key component required for it to work failing is not okay. Other vacuum manufacturers (i.e. Dyson) allow battery replacements at significantly lower (and reasonable) costs

Do not buy a Bosch cordless vacuum EVER"
488,1,"trash, battery dies within a few mins - worthlesshad for nearly 2 years, started off with a battery life of about 15 to 20 mins on high used on floorboards and occasionally carpet. now barely lasts 2 minutes after a full overnight charge. have cleaned and maintained it, the battery is just trash.
for the price i paid 2 years ago, its pretty disappointing! dont waste your money!"
489,1,"If I could give it less I wouldTwo years out of a Bosh stick vacuum purchased from Havey Norman only to find it is impossible to buy a replacement battery. Sorry, I found one supplier on the internet an Australian company and this is from their website. 12027242 BOSCH STICK VAC BATTERY ASSY 25.2V *PLEASE CONTACT STATEWIDE PRIOR TO ORDER Part Number: 12027242 $574.95"
490,1,Regret this purchaseOur Bosch BCH6ZOOAU is a great disappointment. My wife finds it heavy and hard to push across carpets and rugs. She has given up using it. I can push it across rugs and carpets but the pressure seems to push the power head down rather than forward. For hard floors the price is overkill.
491,1,Waste of moneyI've had the same issue with battery life. If on the highest setting it only holds charge for about 1min then dies. Even though the battery indicator would have 3/4 full it dies after 1min. Started out being great... best suction in a stick vac I've had but the battery issue has turned me right off Bosch now unfortunately. Mostly used on tiles and very low profile indoor/outdoor carpet
492,1,"Doesn’t hold charge once warranty endsInitially worked great, long run time on medium setting with good suction and was happy with it. However as time went on it ran out of battery faster and would stop/start whilst vacuuming. Made a warranty claim and unit was replaced due to the intermittent fault (they told me the decreasing runtime was a charger issue and offered a replacement charger until I described the intermittent fault). Replacement unit came with 12m warranty, about 15m after being replaced the second unit also stopped holding charge with runtime decreased to about 5-10mins. Bosch would only offer a discount off a new unit. My ex has the same unit and his has also stopped holding charge again just outside the warranty period. 3 machines all with the same issue. Avoid these unless you’re happy to replace every 2yrs. Not buying another bosch again."
493,1,"Wish I could give it 0 starsBought about 6 months ago, and the battery stopped working at full vacuum about 2-3 months after purchase. I don't recommend buying this product. High price, doesn't last, low quality.
Get a Dyson Animal Ball wall powered instead."
494,1,"Battery is a deal breaker - non repairableGreat vacuum cleaner when it worked. Fantastic on carpet and wood flooring. My favorite vacuum in the whole world but only lasted 2 years then battery went. I tried to get it repaired out of warranty and you can not get the battery repkaced eadily o. These midrls. It cannot be simply taken out and swapped it's a major job and costs as much as a new vacuum cleaner, as well as downtime to have it replaced.
This is so upsetting. Bosch would rather you sent a perfectly good vacuum cleaner to landfill and bought a new one!

Bosch sell the apare part battery in a pack with a computer board and motoe. You can not just buy the battery that needs replacing on its own.

This makes the cost of the repair just for the battery ridiculous.

A deal breaker for me"
495,1,"Huge faultAside from the well documented flimsy neck, the biggest deal breaker with this vacuum is that it dumps a pile of sandy debris when I turn it off. I've cleaned and emptied everything in it, but the problem remains. So now after vacuuming I have to keep it turned to max power, walk outside, and turn it off while still directing it over the garden. This is so it doesn't spit out mess into the just vacuumed house. A vacuum that creates mess. I'll give it to Bosch, they're innovators."
496,1,"An engineers review - DONT buy thisIve both owned and repaired one of these, and others like it. The Athlet has two fundamental flaws, unacceptable on an expensive machine:
1) The batteries cannot (practically) be replaced. Cordless vacs work the batteries hard, especially on the higher settings. So it's perfectly normal for batteries to loose capacity or fail after a few years. That's not specific to Bosch. But by making the batteries non-replaceable Bosch have guaranteed this will only last a few years.
2) The handle snaps. This is a heavy machine with a thin plastic handle. It will snap at the top, rending the vacuum useless. You may be able to glue it together for a short time, but the internal wiring in the handle will soon break. Very poor design.
It is an impressive machine initially.... but it wont last. Dont waste your money and pollute our environment.
Get a machine with a user-replaceable battery - added bonus, you can have a spare battery charged ready if the vac goes flat half way through your house."
497,1,"No battery chargePurchase this appliance 6months ago and at a the price I would not have expected it to be so short lived. The vacuum charge is around 5mins. Hardly time to vacuum a room. I have wood floors. Otherwise this previously was a good, well functioning product - now it is simply useless. Would not purchase another. And had I known that so many others were having this same issue I would not have purchased this one"
498,1,"DissatisfiedThe suction is pathetic
It clogs up after two 10min use
Battery is awful. Only max works and lasts 6 mi a.
The bin doesn’t last more than 6 mins of cleaning."
499,1,"Battery dying... AGAIN!EDIT: After writing this review Product review gave me the option to give Bosch an opportunity to reply prior to posting.. very disappointed to say I have heard nothing from them despite giving them plenty of time to respond...
This is my third Bosch athlet vacuum!
1st - cutting out and was replaced under warranty
2nd - dropped down to 3 mins in less than 1 1/2 yrs.. again replaced under warranty
3rd - down to three minutes in only just over 1 1/2 years even though the majority of the time was only used on timber floors and I'm careful about always cleaning filters...

So now I've resorted to sweeping floors and only use the vacuum for a short burst to suck up the dust pile ... When its new its a great vacuum but at this price point I think I'm justified in having a reasonable expectation that it would last longer. As other reviews have indicated this is obviously a common issue..... and worst still the batteries aren't replaceable ...here we are banning plastic bags but think nothing of being a throw away society when it comes to appliances ...surely Bosch can do better than this"
500,1,"aulty after one useI used this once and amazing suction after the first time now it doesnt suck anything at all and its been like this since October 2021, I tried emptying it and tried cleaned it still no difference. Very disappointed"
501,1,Charge lasts 20minsThe vacuum on full charge lasts about 20 mins in my one bedroom flat. For longer cleans it just doesn't cut it. The suction is great when its charged. I only purchased it 6 months ago. For a $300 vacuum I would have expected a bit more. You also need to buy the attachments for an extra charge of around $70. As the vacuum doesn't fit under furniture due to the motor and cylinder being at the bottom of the vacuum it makes it a pain to try use the extra attachments. Very disappointed.
502,1,"Won't chargeLoved it when I first brought it now after 2 years having problems it won't hold its charge,yes I tried contacting the bosch company sat on phone for 30 minutes they said a operator will ring you back 2 days later nothing ...not happy ..have sent an email also nothing.."
503,1,"Worked well for a week or 2Used on carpet and tiles.
Pet hair got caught in the head and barrel after every use. Would spend more time trying to clear the vacuum than anything else. Terrible, don't buy."
504,1,Throw away once battery is goneBought new for $259 and had it for 2 years. Then battery would not retrain charge for more than 5-6 minutes. Rang Bosch. First told that battery can't be replaced and later that it would cost $212 plus postage.
505,1,"Broken HandleBosch Athlet has a broken handle
Is this covered under warranty
Very dissappointed only had it for short time
Has anyone else had this problem and did it get resolved Thanks"
506,1,Only lasts 1 yearThis is our second vacuum cleaner. First one experienced exact same issues. After a year suction power is none existent as well as battery life. Turbo mode lasts all of 2 minutes and second mode has hardly enough suction to suck sand up. Would not waste time and money on this appliance.
507,1,"Irreplaceable Battery??We bought the Bosch Athlet from Harvey Norman in the late 2016 and have used it on carpet, tile and timber flooring. Thought it was fabulous product for the first year or two!! The use on carpet is a bit hard going, but given the vacuum is only for spot cleaning, I could put up with the exertion. Like many other reviewers on this site, the battery has slowly given up and now, the vacuum will only last for 3-5 minutes on a full charge. After contacting Bosch, I was provided with a new charger, but this was no help. I was happy to buy a new battery, but was told this really wasn't an option. Wish I had of known that when I was shopping for a new vac!! Don't bother with this product."
508,1,"Wouldnt recommendIt was great straight out of the box, i was very impressed with it, however, it went downhill from there. The head of the handle started to crack within a few months and completely broke within 6 months. The battery life also got shorter and shorter, now I only have a 3 min run time. I have since read up on the product and have found people are having the same issues. I wouldnt recommend it."
509,1,"Battery problemAll went well for the first couple of years on carpet and wood flooring, but then the charging became slower and slower until last week when it didn't charge at all. I wish I had reported it sooner and got it mended within the 2 year warranty!! For a global brand this was poor, to say the least."
510,1,"Short lived batteryWas a great vaccuum for just under a year. Gradually lost suction and gradually didn’t last as long. Eventually stopped charging. Phoned place of purchase and they stated I needed to contact BOSCH to obtain a Returns authority number. BOSCH has declined this and instead is providing a replacement charger which will be delivered in one week. Until this is tried I am unable to have a RA number. That’s a minimum of one week without a vaccuum with 2 fluffy dogs depending on this actually working. Surely a vaccuum should last more than a year and surely this could be express posted.
Cord was a success. However head attachment ended up breaking during a change and good guys happily offered a refund or exchange."
511,1,"Bosch vacuum cleaner very dissatisfiedVacuum loses charge only was good for one year I get three minutes its not worth the money
Very dissatisfied
Using on tile floors Held charge for only three minutes very frustrating"
512,1,"Total rubbishHaving had a Bosch washing machine, we thought their vacuum cleaners would be equally good. WRONG. The supposed easy to use handheld gadgets for cleaning stairs is awful and cumbersome. Yes it's sucking power is quite good and the battery lasts long enough before needing to be re-charged. But it sucks all the grit up and then spits it out when at rest. I wish we had paid more money and bought a Dyson. Despite Which? magazine giving this a reasonably good review the truth is it should be on the Don't Buy list."
513,1,"Battery doesn't hold chargeWe've had this vacuum cleaner for a couple of years. It doesn't hold charge for more than 3 minutes, not long enough to do a single room. Super disappointing. It worked pretty well for the first 12 months, so I'd be interested to see how the reviewers above now feel now that they've had the device for a longer period of time."
514,1,"Five stars for first 12 mths...deteriorating sinceLike other reviews, the inability of the lithium iron battery to hold charge is so disappointing, particularly having chosen the Bosch product over alternatives due to the quality of other Bosch products we have. Alas, l fear as the warranty ran out, so did the performance of the battery and from what l researched, purchasing replacement batteries are exorbitantly expensive.....most people have said just bin it and buy an alternative. If l get 2 mins out of it, l am lucky!
Again, disappointing given the performance of other Bosch products……..
HOWEVER…..l cannot fault the service from Bosch Home Appliances who offered a full refund or store credit due to the issues we were experiencing- certainly exceeded my expectations- thank you, once again."
515,1,"Serious construction failureAfter 3 years of use, cracks appeared at the top, just below the hand grip. I sealed the cracks with a strong glue. After 4 years there was more and more play in the place where the top attachment is placed. This became dangerous and I had to seal it with epoxy kit again. Obviously, the engine is too heavy for the far too light plastic construction. I payed for 5 years of warranty but the insurance company told me that I was not covered for cracks in the frame. They explained me that the cracks could have been caused by improper use....."
516,1,"absolute worstI researched a lot before buying this and bought because of its great reviews. I am genuinely surprised by the many good reviews, as I can not agree at all!
Never have I seen a vacuum failing at even the basics. Worst purchase I have done in a long time. I've had this for 2 years or so, really tried to like it.
Spent $300 so I was expecting some value for the money. Could've bought a Kmart Vacuum for 1/3 of the price and been better off.

Lets start with the battery, unless you have it on low (which hardly has any suction), the battery won't last 5 minutes.
It works better on carpet than hard floors. On hard floors you basically just push the dirt around as it won't go under to be sucked in.
But DO NOT pick it up whilst on to put it on top of the dirt (only way it will vacuum it up), as it will literally shoot everything you've vacuumed out and all over the room.

Also don't turn it off and pick it up... because all the dirt will just fall out of the vacuum. (see video, wanted to upload 2 but could only upload 1) so here a link to the second video https://youtu.be/WTcSWM76F98

I had to buy another vacuum and basically only use the BOSCH one when I need to vacuum something up quickly (like crumbs after kids breakfast), but even then I regret not getting my cord vacuum as I always end up with more mess due to dirt falling or shooting out of this thing."
517,1,"Never AgainThis vacuum was terrible. Im so disappointed in it and also LGs follow up. It pulsated, the filter was terrible. I gave up trying to get it replaced and threw my Vac to the tip - $899 that has left a bad feel for LG and I wont buy their products again."
518,1,"Flimsy construction and design flaws make this a vacuum to avoidPROS
• Easy to use - buttons are simple, and pushing it is straightforward.
• Sufficient power for a 3-bedroom house if used regularly.

CONS

• Dock - looks stable but is not. Quite flimsy, wobbly, and lightweight.
• Dock - placing the vacuum into the base is fiddly and requires precise positioning.
• Base - tool storage positions and clips are user-unfriendly and hard to access.
• Multi-surface nozzle often blows larger debris away instead of picking it up.
• Pre-filters do not fit well into the dust bin, preventing the bin lid from sealing properly.
• Dust bin latch is plastic and not sturdy. Have had to have it fixed once already.
• No warranty and service provider in Queensland - have to post product interstate for repairs."
519,1,"Very unsatisfactory after-sale service and defective LG vacuum cleaner attachmentLG A9N-MULTI Red 2 x Battery vacuum cleaner purchased at Harvey Norman in July 2023 for $764.00. The vacuum cleaner has a 24 month warranty. After only a few uses the small combination brush and hard nozzle attachment malfunctioned as the brush section of the attachment failed to lock into place and constantly retracted during vacuuming. I phoned LG to request a replacement attachment. I had already registered the vacuum cleaner warranty online in the LG website. When phoning LG, there is only an obscure recorded message which advises customers to leave a phone number for a return call. When I finally received a phone call from LG, I found that the customer service provided was substandard being ill-mannered, argumentative and berating. I was required to take photographs of both the front and back of the faulty attachment, the Harvey Norman sales receipt and the product label in the interior of the vacuum cleaner and to download and email the photos to LG. I subsequently received an email from LG advising receipt of my complaint, after which I heard no further. After patiently waiting 4 weeks, I sent an email to LG asking when the faulty attachment would be replaced and received no response. Therefore, I telephoned LG and after 30 minutes in which I was constantly put on hold, I was told that LG could not provide a replacement attachment and that I would have to return the faulty vacuum part to Harvey Norman and that the retailer would need to contact LG on my behalf in order to obtain a replacement attachment. If this is LG's standard required process/procedure for replacing a faulty LG vacuum cleaner and/or attachments, then customers should be advised of this from the outset and not subjected to wasting hours of time taking, uploading and emailing photographs and documents to LG when the company clearly has no intention of assisting. I will not purchase any further products manufactured by LG as I consider the purported after-sale ""customer care"" to be defective as was the vacuum cleaner. If customers pay close to $800 for a vacuum cleaner, it is not unrealistic to expect attachments to be sturdy enough to last for more than a few uses. I would not recommend LG products to others."
520,1,Poor qualityProduct is no good the kompressor function don't work wast of money. There's information on the falsely stating that this product base super vacuum all nonsense and warranty is nonsense.
521,1,CUH ts brkemy dawg humped ts out of it mf destroyed it now i cant use it 1 star
522,1,"All LG Cordless Vacuums. Batteries do not last and replacements are expensiveI recently experienced a frustrating issue with my LG stick vacuum's rechargeable batteries. Both batteries failed after precisely two years from the date of sale. Even more concerning, my relative's LG vacuum suffered the same fate after only three years of use. To make matters worse, the cost of replacing these batteries is exorbitant, totalling $350 for a set of two—equivalent to half the price of a new vacuum. This steep expense seriously undermines the product's overall value.
What's even more disheartening is that my experience isn't isolated. Many other users have reported similar battery issues, amplifying the frustration. LG has failed to adequately address the problem. They should offer reasonably priced replacements or introduce design enhancements to improve battery lifespan.

Moreover, the lack of transparency regarding battery lifespan and replacement costs at the point of sale only exacerbates the issue. Consumers are left uninformed and burdened with unexpected expenses.

Now faced with a dilemma, I'm questioning whether to invest in expensive replacement batteries or switch to a different brand, hoping for better longevity. Either way, the prospect of shelling out $350 every few years for a vacuum was not part of the plan. The vacuum is awesome but the batteries let it down.

In conclusion, the battery durability issue in LG stick vacuums is a significant drawback that demands attention. While other manufacturers may face similar challenges with replacement costs, LG and others must address this widespread problem and restore consumer confidence through increased transparency, cheaper replacement parts and product reliability."
523,1,"Worst vacuum ever!!This is the worst vacuum ever just gets stuck with the smallest amount of fluff. If you are someone who doesn’t have any dust any fluff any dirt all this would be a good vacuum for you, but in the real world, this is the worst vacuum ever.!) Don’t buy it’s horrible. Wish I read a review before I bought it I would never buy it."
524,1,"Dust is its kryptoniteWhilst most vacuums are designed with the idea the may get a little dusty, LG seemed to have forgot this could be the case. The A9 blocks up an infuriatingly amount of times in any one session, particularly where the dust intake enters the storage canister. It'll then create pulsating sound as it enters its death throes, pleading to be unclogged even though you did it just 2 minutes ago, scuppered by the very thing it's supposed to combat - dust."
525,1,"Worlds worst vacuum cleanerNot once have I been able to vacuum my floor without the filters clogging and the motor giving up. I tried to complain to Harvey Norman and to LG but they made the process so harrowing and time consuming that more pressing life matters got in the way and I gave up.
I was constantly cleaning filters which threw dust everywhere. So much for allergy friendly.
This is the worst appliance I have ever used.
Absolute not fit for purpose. Do not buy one.
I now own a $1000 white elephant."
526,1,"Poorly built and designed, lasted a solid 4 monthsWeird design flaw where debris gets caught behind the panel used to push waste down (even when barely full) so that effects the overall suction strength.
I was cleaning ours out with a pipe cleaner for the third time in a matter of days and then the lid to the whole cannister snapped off with no pressure at all, can't believe it.
Absolute junk - don't waste your money!"
527,1,"I’m so upset and they wouldn’t do a refundWhen I first got the vacuum I was so excited it worked so well at the store but when I got home and used the mop on my tile floor I found that it only pushed around dirty water after I cut my losses with the mop part I went on to use the vacuum and realised the only time the suction even was when it was on turbo I tried the vacuum with several different attachments one wood flooring, tile, and carpet the only time it ever worked was on carpet after this bad experience I decided to call lg and ask for a refund and they told me the only thing they could do for me was see if there was anything damaged and repair, I went to the repair shop they told me to go to they had it for a week and told me it was fine after I called lg a second time they told me there was nothing they could for me."
528,1,No greatThe head spits out what’s been vacuumed leaving it behind and the battery doesn’t last very long
529,1,"So disappointedWe have purchased two of these vacuums after we had issues with the heads not connecting properly, we thought maybe it was a one off issue. But low and behold, the second vacuum is now playing up. The nozzle started disconnecting intermittently and not it has just gotten worse and worse. I clean the filters after every single use because I thought that would ensure longevity on our second time around with the new vacuum. I have spoken with LG customer service and they just give you same old line ...we need to review the case and see if there are other things to troubleshoot. But who can be without a vacuum for weeks! Time to jump over to Dyson!!"
530,1,FailiureThis vacuum cleaner certainly looks the biz but that’s about it! Main problem is that the suction is very poor and it must be on ‘turbo boost’ all the time which means the battery only lasts 10 minutes at a time. The second battery doesn’t seem to charge in the standalone charger unit even though it shows fully charged. I never use the tools/accessories that came with it because they just don’t work very well…..a hose attachment actually disintegrated within the first few months thereby rendering a couple of the attachments unusable. This machine is not worth the $1000 price tag.
531,1,"It’s broken twice in 12 monthsTwice is the first 12 months i’ve had to send away to get it fixed. Basically in the last 12 months, i’ve been without my vacuum for two months. LG just wants to keep fixing it, but for how long? You buy a new product thinking it will work like it should. I just want a vacuum that works"
532,1,"Absolute LemonI brought this in Oct 22 after reading amazing reviews and well i have had problems ever since.
Brand new from the box, battery charged it started making the noise of the filters had been blocked.
I literally had just turned it on.
Sorted that issue out, then in April 23 the bearing went in the vacuum. Making a crunching noise, electrical smell. Took it back to be repaired. Took a few weeks- all good.
Pick it up end of May and now it’s Sept and the same thing is happening AGAIN!
The $39 vacuum I brought from Target performs better than this.
I do not recommend"
533,1,"Don’t waste your moneyWe had our a9 essential for less than 18 months before the problems started, both batteries stopped working, the power head stopped working, the turbo power mode stopped working, it alternates from high to low power like the filters are dirty but I’ve replaced them and they’re clean. The thing is an absolute lemon."
534,1,"Needy high maintenance cheaply made expensive vacumnThis machine is,constantly bleeping at you with some problem or another. Filters constantly need attention. Battery runs out quick and on hard floors it just spits out the bits behind you. Now its fallen over and the cheap plastic catch on the dust canister has broken off rendering this expensive peice of cheaply put together rubbish totally useless. Dont buy one!!"
535,1,Both Batteries DiedBoth batteries died after infrequent use after 18mo.. Like everyone else.. Costly to replace. There needs to be something done about the batteries.
536,1,"Avoid. High cost to run. High maintenance. Won't last longI've had this about six months. It does the job. The suction is good, with three modes to choose from. Battery life is also good. It's fairly quiet as well.
But... It isn't the one you should buy. Here's why:

- It's expensive. You can't replace parts as the body is one piece, so anything breaks... Need a new one. Replacing the battery costs $40 for the Dyson, $120 for the LG. I replaced them 3x on the Dyson before it died... that's $240 extra, far outstripping any savings on purchase! The filters get clogged and need replacing sooner.

- Maintenance. So much work to keep clean. The filters act like dust traps, so after two rooms and they are clogged up. It's like the vacuum isn't bagless, the filters act like bags. The motor head is a pain to open to clean. The bin won't empty and you can't take it off. You clean the room, then the vacuum. No time saver here.

- Emptying. The small and small bin fills quickly. It traps the dirt between it and the body, so it won't drop out. You find yourself banging it to get it clean risking breaks (my one has a crack in the plastic shell). I now use a long brush to get the dirt out. It's also fixed to the body, so you can't take the bin off to clean it (or replace it).

- The design. Mostly good... But there are these things that just aren't good enough. If you had a Dyson before, you soon appreciate the quality of them. The extending head is great, but too easily it retracts. The head won't sit flush to the floor, so won't vacuum under low beds. The storage design is harder to get the accessories out. The small bin. The clogging filters. The inability to charge a battery except the one in the vacuum. The list goes on and on. They accumulate.

- The one piece body. It really makes the thing disposable. You can't simply remove a part and click in another (except the battery). All the external parts on my old Dyson V6 could be replaced easily and most were.

So... Just get the equivalent Dyson. These things aren't cheaper, better, or even a time saver. I just can't see a reason to get these except the lower initial cost."
537,1,"It broke in less than 2 yearsThe attachment for the stick started to actually crack a few months ago, it has now broken due to that and LG warranty won’t be covering that. I actually liked until it lasted, but it’s made of such a cheap plastic."
538,1,"Poor performance and disappointing product careWe purchased this vacuum in mid 2018 and shortly after purchased a robot vacuum. So we hardly used the LG A9 for anything other than light occasional spot cleaning.
Around mid 2020 we found the vacuum wouldn't hold charge or operate for any longer than 40 seconds. I made contact with LG support and they sent out 2 replacement batteries. Unfortunately DHL misplaced the replacement batteries, and after an 18 month saga, never received them.

As of late March the vacuum doesn't turn on at all, and as of today 3/6/23 we contacted LG to see if there is anything they could do to help - considering the poor performance and very light, occasional use of this vacuum over the past 5 years. To which they referred me to the service store so I could pay to have it looked at/repaired.

I don't like leaving negative reviews (or reviews in general - who has the time?) But, I would like to warn anyone looking to rely on this product, for any reasonable length of time that both the item and the product support has been very poor.

We own a couple of LG appliances and unfortunately this will be out last."
539,1,"Stay clear !Nothing but issues with my vacuum, regrettable purchase ! Lasted three years before it completely feel apart !!! 1000 dollar machine rendered useless in three years !!!"
540,1,"Worst vacuumAbsolutely disgusting. My mum bought this thinking it should be a good easy vacuum for her to use. It's been nothing but a problem from the start. After finally getting a new battery, it litrally only worked well for maybe 3 months. Lucky to get 5 min use and it's flat. The vacuum won't stay on it turns itself off numerous times throughout that 5 min. The turbo head has been replaced also. So considering my mum has a small home and no kids it's definitely not worth $50 in my opinion. The floor is mainly hybrid flooring."
541,1,"LG Cordzero A9NEOMULTIThe LG battery quickly fades after 7 months of use, LG claimed 400w of suction power, unfortunately, the performance is only equal to an old dyson DC Series 35. the power brush is not powerful enough in one pass, need to do 3 passes to have an excellent result. The warranty after 12 months is nil, even though it says 24 months. customer service agents in Melbourne are arrogant and stubborn. @ $799 it's an expensive entry-level cordless vacuum. better go for the dyson V8 series. it's more powerful and handy. nothing beats the original cordless dyson. all clones and cheap imitations of the original, what can you really expect for Low-Grade (LG) electronics? owning an LG product is not always life good experience at all. The former LG name is Lucky Gold AKA Goldstar in the '80s. don't be fooled by their life-good ads."
542,1,"Broke twice in same place over 2 yearsWe bought this vacuum cleaner just over two years ago. It has broken twice in the same place since purchase. The place it has broken in is the black suction joint where the main vacuum pipe plugs into. The 1st time it was repaired under warranty and the 2nd time LG is telling me that it is not covered under warranty. The quality of this product for the amount we paid - $559 - is very poor. It broke for no reason other than, guess what, vacuuming the floor! Complete waste of money. Should have bought something cheaper. The customer service of LG in relation to getting this repaired and warranty claimed has been a really horrible experience. Both the whatsapp and online chat options for customer service have been rude, poor English (not actually making sense) and no return phone calls. I will not be buying LG products again."
543,1,"If you live alone and don’t have pets maybeThis review is really just to expel some anger, having just tried to vacuum. A task that takes more time and patience than I have and should not need. I bought the Cord Zero A9 Ultra Handstick Vacuum with All-in-One Tower about 2 years ago. For some reason, it has been designed with a suction hole the size of a pea. I have mostly hard floors and still have to unclog it, at least 3 or 4 times every vac. I have two dogs and a cat, which in spite of vacuuming daily is far too much hair for this useless item. The spare battery, auto empty, multiple attachments would all be wonderful, if the vacuum could actually cope with dirt and fluff. Which I thought was the job of a vacuum, but apparently not this one. I will never switch from Dyson again, and only keep the stupid thing because it cost me $1800 when I bought it. Not even almost fit for purpose and I really should ask for a refund. Having dealt with LG before though, that task would require High Court and ACCC intervention, so I’ll just suck it up. Unlike the vacuum."
544,1,"No good with dog hairI paid $1100 and hardly use it. Dust accumulates under the head/roller and attaches itself to the little wheels and roller. It then becomes hard to steer and isnt as effective.
Its very well made and sturdy and I like some of the attachments.

I contacted the retailer who contacted their rep who said it is a known problem if there are dogs.
It seems the dog hair attaches to dust and gets clumpy which sticks to the head. The dog hair in my house is not even visible there is so little of it.

To prevent this problem I would have to be vacuuming twice a day at least.

I keep hoping it will improve or I will find a work around, but nothing changes. Ive had it for about one year.

I have reverted back to the BOSCH cordless ive had for some years, which never has this problem.

I wouldnt buy again because of this."
545,1,What a disasterI have been online for over an hour after the tile head failed after twelve months to try and get a replacement. I never had this problem with Dyson
546,1,"batteries are rubbishHi to all. We have had our Cord zero now for a few years. And have had 4 batteries, the first two replaced under warranty. Now the two replaced batteries have failed. The tec guy told me the batteries are testing fine, if you open up the case. it's the little board on top of the batteries that's no good. We have finely learnt our lesson Not to buy LG. Even cheap product's like Ozito there batteries last for years in fact over 7 years. Yet you spend $800.00 on LG Cord zero and lucky to get 3 years use out of 4 batteries. Come on LG lift your game. 5 bad stars to LG. ,"
547,1,"Was working well! But broke after less than two yearsWe were happy with the vacuum, but I expect a product like this to be designed to put up with the pressure while cleaning (physically), I can’t believe that this product is made of plastic that broke after two years! Contacted customer support! They did not help,, i can’t believe that"
548,1,"Bad odour from the unit and it is getting worseBought it early this year and loved it at first so convient being wireless, but it started to smell this odd and unpleasant odour when operating. I cleaned every part of the unit where possible but the smell wouldnt go away. So I took it back to the shop thinking I probably need to get it looked into. Sent it for a repair and we were without a vaccum cleaner for three weeks. It came back with a note ""Dry well after use"" or something similiar, dry how? it is left standing as instructed in the utility room when not in use. Anyway, we stopped using it in bathrooms, just in case. That was in May.
However, the smell gotten progressively worse now we are at the point reluctant to use it at all due to the awful odour coming from the unit when operating. The smell is so strong we can smell it as soon as the power button is on and the smell is spread around the house. We have to open the windows to get the odour out of the house after the vacumming. Which is quite an irony, this unit is supposed to keep houses clean! Our house has got the hard floor (tiles) & carpeted floor just like any other houses in QLD. We dont use it for anything else other than its built purpose. So disappointed. It was the purchase I was really excited about.

All my family back home use LG products, for ALLL house applicances. I have LG for all my applicances. Now Im actually considering to buy a new vacuum clearner - Cant stand the smell - I dont think Im going to get a LG. What a waste of my hard earned money! Disappointing they would not replace it even within the guarantee period"
549,1,Do not buyHorrible mopping function - leaves tiles streaky with visible water droplets. Contacted the retailer and LG regarding this quality issue within a few days of purchase and they said nothing can be done until the unit is assessed. I drove 2 hours in total to drop off the unit. It was deemed as functional despite the poor mopping. I will not purchase another LG product given the customer service and quality of this product.
550,1,Both batteries failedBoth batteries failed & will not charge. Just had to spend $130 on a replacement battery as I can't get them replaced under warranty. Seems LG have a problem with these batteries & is a common fault. I would recommend buying a different brand.
551,1,DisappointedUsed on tile floors and rugs.The battery is too hard to change and now its not charging at all.Because it was expensive I would like to try to keep going with it. The suction was'nt that good either
552,1,"I thought it was great when I bought it new...35 months on?I have been using this vacuum now for just under 3 years, vacuuming a 2 bedroom unit. Now after owning it for 35 months, 11 months outside the LG warranty period, I have found out that I need to replace the two batteries, two (2) batteries at $175.00 each from LG totalling another $350.00 on top of the purchase price of approximately $800.00 in 2019. Not impressed, this is my first experience buying an expensive vacuum cleaner. It works out that for the purchase price ($800) it has cost me around $25.00 per month to vacuum my floors for the past 35 months, and now it is going to cost me around 42% of the purchase price to replace the batteries. (Note: I have a battery operated drill, that will allow me to drill concrete with a longer life battery in it than in an LG A9 Master battery powered vacuum). In summary - a good product when new, but a piece of crap when the LG warranty runs out. Not impressed LG!
I will never purchase another battery powered vacuum again!!!."
553,1,Both Batteries are deadGreat vacuum until both batteries died after 2 years of infrequent use.
554,1,BOSCH - GARBAGE YEP GARBAGESince we bought this machine we have been plagued by the constant red sensor light going on stopping the vacuum! With over eight pages of the same problem Bosch should be ashamed of putting a faulty designed vacuum into the marketplace ! Bosch find a fix and redeem some goodwill ! Its misleading and deceptive conduct in my book! SHAME on you
555,1,"Sensor control issuesHad the BGS41PETAU for 3 months and paid $799. Suction drops down and need to keep turning machine off and on again. Only works for 5 minutes and cuts down again. It is cleaned after every use, including the filters but still won’t work. Very unhappy with this product"
556,1,Sensor control issueI bought this vacuum about 5 years ago I think or less. I'd say I solidly used the vacuum for 2 years and had go store it for a bit between moving houses etc. I have recently for a year have not used it due to using it for 1min and the sensor control light goes on and it cleans the filters. Have to keep turning off the vacuum and turning it back on to use it for only 1min. I have had to use a work vacuum to vacuum my house. I have tried cleaning the filters and the vacuum but don't know what else to do to stop this issue. Please advise on what I need to do. This vacuum was not cheap. I also live In NZ so NZ contact information would be preferred.
557,1,"Don’t waste your money on this vacuumI bought this vacuum cleaner two years ago battery does not last 60 minutes as stated lucky to last half that time Bosch have replaced the battery for me but this one is worse than the original I’m still waiting for a decision from Bosch as to what they going to do for me.
we have polished floorboards and tiles and struggles to clean those floors it would have no hope on carpet. The vacuum is very noisy and not very sturdy in its upright position"
558,1,"Expensive vacuum that is terribleThis vacuum has a “self clean” function that activates every 30 seconds or so WHILE YOU ARE USING IT!!! So while you are trying to vacuum, it will turn itself off, and won’t function. I have cleaned filters and done all I can to try and stop it, nothing works. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to be sacked. About to throw it out the window. Expensive vacuum that is unusable."
559,1,"Went from being the best to the worst....just like the others hereBought about 5 years ago, consciously avoiding the other brand. Occasional use for a small 2 bed carpeted unit. I have maintained it well but the self cleaning occurs every 30 seconds and power is well down. Unusable and now looking like I'll just have to discard it. I feel that the machine's clever technology has been its downfall. Zero marks on the sustainabilty front."
560,1,"Really bad vaccuumI brought this as I love bosch produxts5, but disheartened with this one. I went to the store to return it they wouldn't as they said 10% cash hold back they even tested it to make sure it is good. This doesn't pick up animal hair at all. Batery doesn't last for 60 min , it would be less than 20 min for me. I paid $450 thinking this is better than dyson but disappointed. Now it stopped picking up the rubbish from the floor but the reverses the rubbish from it bag and leaves it the on the floor"
561,1,"A Disappointing PurchasePurchased this vacuum cleaner just over 24 months ago. I have 2 dogs and because of this I selected this cleaner as it advertised it was suitable for using on carpets and hard floors where animals live. For the first 6 months everything was great but then the cleaner started giving problems with the self-cleaning function. It switches on every 20 to 30 seconds and I have to wait for it to stop before I can continue with the operation. I was told at the store where I purchased it that it was because of the filter needing replacing as the filter is not washable despite what it states in the advertising. I have replaced it twice subsequently, but it continues to switch to self-cleaning mode every 20 or so seconds and even sometimes gets stuck there. I have to switch it on and off to stop it. Now going to have to purchase another brand. Really not worth the expense and not what I would expect from such a well known brand."
562,1,"Don’t waste your moneyI’ve had this vacuum for over 5 years. I agree with basically everything that the one star reviews say. The suction is great and this machine is sturdy and feels like good quality gear. But it’s a total disappointment. And annoying as hell to use. This is because the sensor light goes red and it basically stops working and whirs around doing a reset before restarting if it actually starts at all. The only way to get it to work is to switch it off and on again. The filters are definitely not washable. I empty this out and tap the filter clean every use, and it makes no difference. I think there is a major disconnect between the claims and reality. I’ve bought a replacement filter (the small one that goes inside the unit not big central one that sits in the dust collector) and it hasn’t done a thing. This was an expensive purchase and is annoying as all hell. For the price and the name you just want something that lasts and keeps going. I just want to clean my floor. This is so frustrating. Don’t buy this vacuum it will annoy you and annoy you and annoy you."
563,1,"Worst vacuum cleaner I’ve ever owned-can’t rate itLike all the other reviews here, I have had no end of trouble with this vacuum cleaner. I bought this after owning Dyson’s and Miele my entire life. The first 6 months it was ok, but after that the sensors keep moving through 3 zones of filtering and it basically stops working. The only way to get it started is to turn it off and back on again- it lasts for about 2 min and then does the same thing. I clean all filters each time it is used- simply because, as an asthmatic, I need it to work. I took it back to my place of purchase, they tested it and were also appalled. They said they would replace the main filter for me, which they did, but it did not really resolve the issue- it went for 4 days before it was back to the same issues. The place I purchased it from now refuses to stock Bosch vacuum cleaners. I paid $800 for this cleaner and it really needs to go, but I in not in the position to replace it."
564,1,"The worst vacuum cleaner everWe have had this vacuum around 3 years. It was advertised as all filters being washable. But that is not true. The one filter that constantly needs cleaning is not washable. This is why the machine constantly stops to self-clean and then loses suction. Bosch replaced the filter once, as they know there is an issue, but it has happened again only about a year after that. We have given up and bought a Miele. Expensive mistake as the Bosch cost over $700."
565,1,Total Rip Off!!!Went well for 2 years then red sensor light started coming on & stopping vacuum every 30 secs. Happens constantly now. Tried cleaning all filters & rotating head every time but still keeps shutting off. Chord retracts during use & won’t fully return leaving a metre outside. Hard to manoeuvre as keeps flipping on its back upon turning. It’s heavy to push back onto its right side. Most expensive & WORST machine I have ever bought at $600. I will NEVER buy Bosch again & be letting everyone not to go near them like the plague!!!
566,1,"Great at firstI bought this model vacuum at Harvey Norman, Young, in 2014. I had gone in there intending to buy another Dyson, but the salesman talked me into the Bosch, which came with a turbo head included. His main selling point was its quietness and that it boasted a ""self-cleaning filtration system"". I caved and bought it, also purchasing an extended warranty for it.
During the first year, this vacuum was a dream; I had dogs and cats, plus birds, and it sucked up their mess with ease. I also enjoyed how quiet it was, even on full power.

In 2015, the turbo head started not working properly, ie, the brushes wouldn't turn and the suction was useless. My partner, or I, also had to sit and remove countless hairs from the roller, but to no avail.

We tried using the contact head, but this made the job very hard indeed, even though it picked up everything on full power, it was impossible to push along the carpet without incredible strain on our backs. We took the turbo head back to Harvey Norman, Young, and after a fair while of being mucked around - mainly because the head was considered an optional extra, which it wasn't - Bosch finally replaced it. If memory serves, that took weeks to resolve.

A year later, the replacement turbo head started mucking up like the original one. We took it to Harvey Norman in Goulburn, where we were living during that year, and a wonderful staff member cleaned it out, pointing out TWO OTHER filters we weren't aware were in the machine! Even though this model was a self cleaning filtration system, we both still cleaned the one filter we knew of, but not knowing about the location, or existence, of the other two filters, we'd mistakenly left them filthy. So the ""user manual"" that came with the machine was pretty useless. To be expected I guess, from a ""manual"" that was a folded up piece of paper that opened out to nearly as big as a small tablecloth; awkward to hold and read, and to be brutally honest, not a great reflection of the price I paid ($900 including extended warranty). Again, the machine worked well for a short while, but reverted to its usual poor performance.

It's now 2020, well over five years since purchase of this machine. We continue experiencing nothing but trouble with the turbo head, have taken to using the contact head, and have to take turns vacuuming, as it's such hard work pushing the machine over our carpet and rugs. But if we turn the suction down, it doesn't pick up much, requiring us to go over the one spot twice or three times, or more, to pick up small bits of fluff. I forgot to mention that the machine has taken to constantly stopping, to clean the filter supposedly, starts again, then stops again after a minute or so of cleaning. That's after the canister has been emptied and the filter given a firm whacking for dust!

This vacuum is now out of warranty, so we are stuck with a useless machine that was never worth the $900 price tag I paid five years ago. They should perform at a high standard for much longer than one or two piddly years. Turbo heads are also a rort if you ask me, as they don't work for long, as our experience proves. Not to mention the retracting cord that never retracts when you want it to; it only retracts WHEN YOU'RE USING IT. Geeze.

We hate vacuuming these days, as this machine's performance has been nothing short of poor for most of five and a half years of owning it, and it makes a difficult job even harder for two people with back problems. Should we have taken the whole thing back to Harvey Norman a year ago or earlier? You betcha! But we were too busy having just moved house again, so kept cleaning filters, blowing them out with our air compressor, and doing the same to the turbo head. It'd work like a charm for two or three vacuums, then back to poor performance, requiring us to drag the compressor out AGAIN. Trust me, we meant to take this vacuum back under Customer Care, but didn't make it in time, more's the pity.

So, we're not happy with this purchase at all. It appears they come at too high a price, only to start mucking up after one to two year's use. I expect much, much more from such an expensive price tag.

I would not recommend this model, or brand, vacuum cleaner to anyone, as it seems more recent versions of it behave similarly to ours, as reviews I've read prior to posting, have shown.

NOT HAPPY BOSCH!"
567,1,"Red light no suctionI didnt realise this was so common. Wish I had before we purchased a Bosch.
We weren't happy with the level of suction at first but thought that we had spent the money and if we looked after it it'll last us forever.
Within weeks of passing warranty we started seeing the red light.
Wasn't much better than a broom to start, now it's more of a scraper.
If this is so common surely there's a common solution, or should I be looking for a new vacuum?"
568,1,"Worst vacuum cleaner ever rang Bosch they are not interested will never buy Bosch in anythingWorst vacuum cleaner ever stops going into sensor mode filters are clean dont buy Bosch they are not helpful
Just want to sell you a filter which could buy another cleaner for"
569,1,"Terrible productI am very disappointed with this product. Not long after the warranty ran out the machine started stopping and the sensor light would come on. I would clean it but it would still happen. I took it to a service department, had it repaired which cost almost $300. Just over 12 months later it is having the same problem.
It is not worth the cost to have repaired again so will just get rid of it."
570,1,"My first ever Bosch product - and lastBought the Bosch Athlet Zoo'o Pro Animal vacuum cleaner about a year ago. Worst electrical product I've ever bought. Battery lasted barely 9 months and the thing couldn't even suck up typical household crumbs due to a clear design flaw with the head, where you give it a tap after switching off and all the crap collected in the head falls on the floor. Terrible product. Bosch should stick to whatever it is they do best. Not sure what that is, but it's not vacuum cleaners."
571,1,What a big disappointment and waste of moneyIve had the same problem with my vacuum cleaner - I rang Bosch - after cleaning all the filters - completely wiping it out thoroughly- only to be told (we arent aware of the problem) heres a service place to take it too - when spending the amount of money I did on it - I would expect it to last more than 12 months- and the service I received when enquiring about it was terrible- Im really disappointed and upset
572,1,"So dissapointedWhen i purchased this product was happy with the power and suction but soon the problems begun, the same issues as everyone else seems to be having. Cuts out all the time and cant even get through the whole house withput it stopping completely. Its been serviced, has new filters and filter in the barrel gets washed now after each use which still hasn't solved the issue. Wrote to Bosch...no response. Called Bosch...customer service agent was not helpful at all. Seems i am another customer who has had the same experience. Not a positive one which is very dissapointing. Its not an old machine and most vaccuum brands last for years.
Now I am wondering how Bosch will help?
Not a cheap machine."
573,1,"Not impressedNot great for the price I paid for it. It's okish when it works. But it works rarely. We are currently undergoing a full house renovation and the vaccum can't handle it. It can't handle the dust, it always stops to self clean or sensor control or whatever it is. To stop it from frequently stopping we always have to empty it out, even then that doesn't help. The vaccum will randomly just stop sucking up dust and you need to shake it to get it to work again. Also the cord is useless. It won't wind itself up, only winds back up if I force it.
Not happy at all with this vaccum. It's rather useless."
574,1,"Self cleans every 30 secondsI wouldn't recommend this vacuum at all. It self cleans every 30 seconds and it has always done this, regardless of how clean the filter is. I have had it sent off only to be told it was fine but it clearly isn't. Now it is out of warranty and after several attempts to get help from Bosch, I am stuck with a faulty expensive product which leaves me unable to purchase another one. Highly disappointed."
575,1,Biggest mistake I have madeI bought this 3 years ago and have had no end of trouble. It stops with the red light after every few minutes of vacuuming. Now 3 years later it just died. Wont turn on at all. My old dyson lasted 15 years. This was a bother to clean as well. I wont be buying Bosch again.
576,1,"Tired of all the problems1. Vaccum worked well when first purchased, both on carpet and hard floors. But then the faults crept in.
2. The sensor continually cuts in when working on hard floors but does not do this using the turbo head.
3.The cord has a mind of its own, it retracts when you don't want it to and then when you do want it to retract it fails to go all the way in leaving about a metre sticking out.
4. The turbo head now will not work properly only going at about half speed even though I have cleaned it.
5.The filter clogs easily.
6. I will not buy another Bosh.
5.The main filter requires constant cleaning an it clogs up easily."
577,1,"Not worthy of the name Bosch2 Stars, why? The suction on this machine is great, the tools which come with it as well. But then there's the self cleaning function, the worst feature Bosch could've put into this otherwise great machine. With 2 dogs you get dirt in your house, but do you really need to fully wash that filter after every time you vacuum? I already got the previous model replaced as it was constantly cleaning, the new one is the same. I'm so disappointed to have spent so much money on this machine, we own several other Bosch devices but we'll never have another one of their vacuum cleaners. If you buy a Bosch vacuum, make sure it hasn't got the self cleaning feature, if they have a machine without it."
578,1,"Keeps Stopping to Sensor CleanRight from first use the Sensor Clean function keeps turning on after a couple of minutes. Tried clearing, cleanin filters etc. No change. And so it goes... Vaccum. Stop. Turn off and on. Repeat 50 times. Sent in for repairs nearly 2 months ago. Still waiting...."
579,1,"So much for German engineering!Unlike some others, I find the suction on this vacuum to be it's best feature. On hard floors, the sideway action wheels are helpful but not so much on carpet. I have had the ""retractable"" power cord replaced as it wasn't working properly and one day I ripped it out accidentally as my 'gentle' tugs to initiate retraction didn't seem to be working. The replacement cord is already showing signs of being similarly unobliging. The cord's length is also found wanting - I nearly always use a small extension cord to minimise power point changes. I had to buy a new extension tube as the plastic clip on the under side broke and now I need a new hose as it has almost torn through near the handle - possibly from the wear and tear of dragging around a relatively heavy machine. Emptying the barrel is a messy task and one that needs doing frequently to prevent setting off the 'sensor control' function (which isn't working properly anymore either). I would not recommend this machine to anybody and, like others, regret being talked into it by the salesperson at Harvey Norman."
